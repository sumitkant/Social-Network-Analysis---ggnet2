Its been a real pleasure having you around. And do always keep in touch.  "

I don't sing otherwise, but Waving Flag with you makes for the best after-party . You are gem of a person. Keep spreading joy like you always do. Will cherish all the times we spent together! :D  "
abm12001,kushal shiv,HappyGoLucky,,,"Baba.. Aap ki Jai Ho!! The coolest guy in the group who can't literally feel any pressure be it quiz, assignments or freaking end sems. He is an excellent guitar player and band manager. If you grind his CV in a mixer and extract the content you will find umpteen ABM jargons and music accomplishments. Kushal for you I have just one song ""banao banao banao banao banao banao banao.. Right Now!!"" :P    "
abm12001,kushal shiv,Aalsi,,,His laziness and ability to hog food is beyond any explanation. Thanks for keeping the wing's musical tempo always up during these two years. Wishing you best for future :)

abm12001,kushal shiv,Dhongibaba,,,The guy switching between being a vegetarian and non-vegetarian at his whims! Bonfires on the roof was more happening only because of this guy's recitals of the same songs over and over. You are a rockstar!     
abm12001,kushal shiv,smiley_face,,, You are the most tension free and chill person i have come across in my life..stay so.. and keep smiling...:P            
abm12001,kushal shiv,DhongiBaba,,," Always smiling! Gareebon ka Ali Zafar, fabulous singer and a great guitarist. There's a rumor that when he levitates when he is meditating. Some believe it to be true, backed by his 'lighter than air' physique.   "
abm12001 ,kushal shiv,Arre,Kriya,Smile,"Kushal is one person is always smiling no matter what. Kitni bhi fati ho, you can trust him to be smiling. If you tell him to do some work, you can be certain that it won't be done. He won't bother to tell you and if you do happen to ask, his response will be – Arrrrreeeeee yaaaaaarrrrr bhul gya! An amazing and brilliant singer. Always up for it in parties and in cabs.  "
abm12003,Vibhor Jain,,,,
abm12003,Vibhor Jain,Hyperactive,Fun,Cool,"I remember we got to know during the time of 1st section party. I was somehow able to have a good connect with you. Had a nice time including fun as well academic nightouts. Those academic nightouts actually turned out into less of studying more of fun. Stex was also fun alongwith you, though you ditched me in most of the trips. I will not be forgiving you for that. But still going to college and cooking at home was pretty interesting. Our some of biggest goofup moments during stay in europe and also after coming from europe have showed us how smart managers we are.We have shared deep held secrets of ours with each other. You are the person in front of whom I can be total myself and share anything I want to. You are one of the few people in the world with whom I have openly  shared joy & sorrow .We have had a very eventful these 2years journey.  "
abm12003,Vibhor Jain,Dexter,,,The first year was fun with you. I still can visualize the way u used to rotate your chair and continuously pester Shalini. You are one of a kind. Fun to be with. Be stupid. Be jolly. Stay in touch always.       
abm12003,Vibhor Jain,Jolly,Humble,Smart,"You are one of the jolliest persons I have ever met! And sometimes creepy too :P I still remember how during the initial days, in one class, you took my pen, opened it up and kept all the pieces in front of me! I didn't even know how to react! And your obsession with Swiss knife! :D That's crazy!
Yet having said all of that, you are a very humble guy. You always downplay yourself and yet you do everything so sincerely. In all the projects that I have been with you, you always seem to be escaping work and yet end up doing most of it! You are really capable and knowledgeable and I have no doubt that you are going to prosper in life!  Wish you all the very best!           "
abm12003,Vibhor Jain,SwissKnife,,,"The Viber of Section A, we started our cute fighting right from term 1. You always know how to make me feel out of the group with your Hindi :P (Just Kidding)..hehe.. more serious stuff, we had laughs & fights,built some beautiful memories, and were good friends.. Just wanted to thank you for all those amazing moments.. Hoping to create many more in our upcoming grad trip :P                  "
abm12003,Vibhor Jain,ABM,Smart,Entrepreneur,"Vibhor bhai, we took each other's cases all over the two years we were on campus. However, I concede today that talking to you was always fun. I'll always cherish the long chats we have had about business and about life goals. Without doubt, you'll run a large business soon enough!                   "
abm12003,Vibhor Jain,Funny-guy,,,"You're probably one of the funniest people I've met on campus! Your easy going and fun-loving nature in light of deadlines made project submissions look manageable (SM-Vodafone) while group dinners simply weren't the same without you. You're smart and there is no doubt that you'll do excellent in the years ahead. Still, wishing you the same. :)          "
abm12003,Vibhor Jain,Story-master,,," You are a social bee. A new social setting infuses you with enthusiasm. For you, people and stories are life savers. It was interesting to hear your stories, I hope to listen to more of them in the days to come. 

      "
abm12003,Vibhor Jain,.,,,"Vibhor, I am not sure if you remember how and when we first met. It was pretty much towards the end of first year. Something extraordinally adventurous must have happened that day, like it always does when we plan something :P I can never forget sleeping outside the closed Paris BVA ariport, the Croatia drive, passport tragedy in Greece, fine, Yes bank ATM in hazratganj. Anyways, back then, I was clueless that we'd develop such a strong bond. The last one year with you has been one rollercoaster ride, giving me memories for a lifetime. Those 100s (maybe even 1000s) of campus walks, early morning breakfasts, dominos, cokes, chitchatting for innumerable hours…I am gonna miss all this so much! IIM Lucknow wouldn't have been the same for me without you. You are one of the most caring persons I have met till date.  So caring that you spoil others around you! A perfectionist – everything needs to be perfect in everything. Extremely talkative and restless, you bring joy to everything around you.  Foodie at core. Needless to say, you are among the best things that happened to me on campus &#9786;                    "
abm12004,Darshan Shinde,Game_On,,,"PJ King, Lazy, Full on Gamer and consistent in your own way. Mr. DAS, you have a unique personality. Always making everyone laugh, and making everyone think twice about their own exams. Really we all enjoyed quite a lot in the classes. Being with you in IGFAB and in classes was just awesome. You can make any damn situation chill, create jokes in most random, unexpected and sometimes irritating ways as well. But at the end, I would definitely say that without you, the entertainment quotient would have fell quite a lot. And its really good to see your strict side as well. You and Kushal define IGFAB. Would miss your jokes. Enjoy a lott. And do keep in touch.  "
abm12004,Darshan Shinde,Bold,,, Amazing guy. witty and daring. Not afraid of more than 20% class bunks!
abm12004,Darshan Shinde,The Gamer,The Backchood,War Donation 1:1," The most bindass gamer I know till date. We met on COBBLESTONE, both didnt knew wht d heck v wer doin thr so v took d TRAIN to INFERNO. It was too hot, v could c MIRAGE. we took shelter in LOWER TUNNEL whch led us to PAYLOAD ARENA. By this time we were exhausted to we decided to PASS TIME.We were spending our VACation on KING OF THE HILL, but MONGOLS, Spanish and PERSIANS surrounded us with their filthy CANNONS and TREBUCHETS (a type of catapult :P). We unleashed our level 6 DRAGONS, used our mighty RAGE SPELL and unforgiving maxed out BALOONS, HOGS served the enemy on a silver platter for our VALKYRIES. We secured our CONTROL POINT like a pro. After HEAVY and SPY'S flawless performance we moved to 2FORT. That was wasn't easy, we loaded our GLOCKs and USPs and charged our enemy from hard LONG RUSH. There were bullets flying everywhere, grenades creating havoc and smoke and fire did their bit to create one hell of a chaos. By the time DUST settled we were ready for our next CO-OP mission. And don't forget those unholy yet tasty scams we got ourselves into (SPAM KILLS, (BOGO :P)). Thanks for making these 2yrs memorable, obviously with all your noobness :P. The End? ~ CyCL0Tr0N aka "

abm12005,Devika Mathur,Lively,,,"You are one of the most lively person I know. Do remember things change and so do people. But never ever let that affect you. I know you have been through a lot. And somehow it is all past us and you he emerged as even more mature and stronger then ever before. And yes last thing but most importantly if you want something very badly the go for it, at the end f it all that matters is did you fight for what you want. Else you will regret  lot in life."

abm12006,Shivani Nayaka,Mango,,,"You are one of the most fun loving person I have met on campus. Over 2 years there have been more than a fair number of times I have gotten on your nerves but still you keep on brushing it aside and keep getting me stuff to eat. I know I have been quite an a**h**e to you but then thats because I care for you a lot. All the conversations, project discussions and the food we have had in your room will forever be etched in memory. Even though you are younger than me by age you will always be the big sister I never had. :)       "

You are the rare person who is actually quite serious about the work and also can keep the atmosphere quite light and humorous. Not just your inputs but your punch lines and comments are part of many good memories. Really enjoyed a lot. Hope you have the best of the futures. Enjoy a hell lot.

abm12008,Shaumik Daityari,Pseudo-Delhiite,PS4,ResearchPaper,"I doubt anybody obsessed with the aforementioned as much as you. Any holiday Off to Delhi, any free time, PS4 and any other issue, read a research paper. I haven't had that sort of advise ever before joining here. (Apparently 5 years changes outlook). Frankly, a major part of my reason of coming to Hell as since you also got through as well. Pretty sure amongst the smartest people I have met. Go get a PhD. Corporate is not for you. Dont do my mistake.    "
abm12009,Parul  Juniwal,Buddy,Smart,Friend," Parul, you are my ABM buddy. You were my first friend at IIML. Remember that night in your room when we danced to ""Gulaabo"".

abm12011,Sunita  Pateer,Light_Lo!,,,"You and I have rarely agreed on the same thing. But I guess you would agree on this that you were a superb and a fantastic friend. My closest friend in ABM. Really enjoyed all the classes and projects and everything with you. The trips and many innumerable memories. Though I know I and our common friend, both of us have irritated you to max extent possible. Thanks for bearing with us. And I personally feel you are a genuinely good person. You are one of my best friends here. Always be happy and smiling like you always are. And do know that you can always count on us too. We would always be there for you, no matter what. Just like you have been there for me. Life would really have been dull without you. And quite thirsty as well. Thanks for every single thing. May you always be happy.     "

Something which I would never forget!! The birthday note which you left on my door is something which will be treasured. Do stay in touch.. Wish you the best!!             "
abm12011,Sunita  Pateer,Assertive,,,"Her simple sober and ""Apan"" attitude will make anyone fall for her. From the endless nakhre in trial rooms of trying out a dress to the adorable manner in which she outshined in the photoshoot by the end of 2 years is indeed a journey I personally enjoy :P
Have a great future dear and live your dreams in Germany           
"
abm12011,Sunita  Pateer,open-hearted,lively,understanding," Talking to you is always fun girl. Your passion for everything is amazing, from sports to phone (sorry  i-phone). You are always ready for outings and you are always on your feet. Thank you for clicking so many pictures and then sending them to us. Thank you for being the selfie stick of the group. I love the fact that saumya, you and me had our trio pic or shall I call it the ""3 idiots pic"" as the dp in most of our watsapp groups. You are a resourceful and a people's person. You are always surrounded and loved by people wherever you go: from mess to the class. It was fun watching you paying attention in every class sitting in the first row in the first year. You have an amazing way of dealing with people; even the recruiters understood that in very few minutes during the placement process! Though i cannot forget the way you lured me 11th hostel, yet it has been a fun ride here, going to meals with you. Thank you for all the memories from dancing at parties to old songs, onam festival, diwali and even talking about people whom we do not like. Your love for movies is appreciable, especially your love for typical dialogues like 'he is a cheater'. Lets have a quiz & 2 movies together again :DWish you luck for the future!  "
abm12011,Sunita  Pateer,Pehlwaan,Smiling,Friend," For some strange reasons, I always found her in the mess only. :P And I pulled her leg a lot, calling her 'pehlwaan' and urging her to eat more, but never did she take any offense. Surely her ever smiling face and carefree laughs make her more interesting and friendly. The fellow jaipurite is one of the solid pillar of famous 'prerna batra daaku gang' but still, she refused her prom invitation for again some mysterious reasons. Gud luck for your future Sunita. Laugh more and most importantly, eat well. :D                         "
abm12011,Sunita  Pateer,Sarcastic,Tom,," I got to know you during the lunch time gossip sessions that we used to have in first year. From the beginning only, I thought you were my type. I really loved your sarcastic comments and I realized that we will be friends for a really long time. All those walks after dinner and all those things that we shared with each other made our bond stronger. I know I was not able to give you time earlier, and I am making up for that. 2nd year was fun and memorable because of you. I don't have many words to say but I hope you understand what I'm trying to say. I wish all the happiness for you. You know I'll be there for you whenever you need me.   "
abm12011,Sunita  Pateer,Sports,,," A.k.a Sanita, the most athletic person I have seen at IIM L.when you play for the first time, I don't know how you manage to play so well.

abm12014,Priyanka Grover,Caring,,," Mumbai would have been impossible to survive if your motherly instincts did not kick in. It was great bonding with you over our shared love for dogs initially and then pretty much everything under the sun. Hell, you even got me to start liking watermelon juice. Mumbai was one hell of a 2 months thanks to a psycho landlord, crazier flat mates, and a super intensive internship. And I am glad that I had your company for the journey. Our LOTR marathon is due. I hope we complete that soon. Loads of love coming your way :* "

abm12014,Priyanka Grover,Ghissu,,, Grover..Thanks for all the beautiful memories that we shared in this 2 years ( most of them are very recent though :p). You have always been an amazing friend and a beautiful soul...I will always miss our Lucknow outings and night mess tea sessions followed by campus walk. Thanks for making me watch LOTR :p..But a lot of items in our bucket list are still pending. Our jogging plans never materialized.So get bangalore as your job location and we will tick off half of our bucket list there. All the best for future :) :)   
abm12014,Priyanka Grover,Sweetheart,,," I never had a chance to spend too much time with you but whatever we had, I am sure that you are an amazing and genuine person.

abm12015,sushil kumar,Crreativity,Eccentricity,Aloofness," Oftentimes Sushil is the madman of the group. His ideas are over the top and brilliant. When all else fails, we inevitably turn to Sushil. He is a very passionate individual with a love for travelling, biking, photography and gaming. He excels at each of those things. Sometimes I wonder what on Earth he's doing at a B-school. This guy needs to be travelling the world, clicking photographs for Nat Geo.       "
abm12015,sushil kumar,Haggu,,,"Gyani baba....I guess saare college ke professors ko itna gyaan nahi hoga..jitna akela tujhe h..:p Bhai...it was always fun to irritate you, have random discussions on random topics and listening to your highly illogical logics. But in the end I always admired your confidence and knowledge. I am sure you will do great in your career. Just put your 'jugaadu' mind and ideas in the right direction. Wish you all the best for future. Stay in touch.      "

Wish you best of luck for your future. Dhoom macha dena :D   "

What to say, what to say for you….haan exactly that is what I intended to say. You are very passionate about trekking and travel so I wish that you travel as many new countries as possible. And one thing I would like to say, please be patient in everything. You will be successful when you will try to understand the reality and try to adapt yourself according to environment. All the best. "
abm12016,Swapnil Dhoke,Chai-garam,Optimism,,"Swapnil, aka brains, is like Uncle Iroh. The cause of and solution to all of his life's problems lies in one thing – Tea! This guy will come dragging his flip flops and knock on your door at sharp 11 pm (the time when night mess opens), with a wide grin on his face, and ask, ""Chai?"" Tea is the source of all of his happiness! He'll have at least 4 cups at the night mess alone. Chai apart, I really ADMIRE your optimism bro! Doesn't matter how hopeless the situation is, doesn't matter if everyone else has given up and is cribbing, this guy will always have an upbeat attitude. He's really a go getter! Bro, you're gonna achieve big things in life! You are going places.            "

abm12018,Tejas Patil,Chava,,," Teju, u are the best and the only brother I have in this college. I still remember the day hen while eating dosa, I decided to tie rakhi to you and we got this tag. After that, its fun to support you, emotionally blackmail you and get your care. You are the only person for whom even my mom reminds me to take kaju barfi along. Your messages were the best gift I got on rakshabandhan. That made my day. As you say, "" Theek hai, theek hai, ek hi to behen hai meri"". Same goes for me also, "" Jaisa bhi hai, hai to mera bhi ek hi bhai yha par"". So, as you one told that I have not written anything for you, Here are they:
Apne dolo sholo se karta hai sabke dil par raaz
Apne chava ke paas hai best model ka taaj
Us par hai cricket aur volleyball ka nasha chaaye
Kaju barfi hai uski narazgi ka upaaye
Is safar me maine hai ek nayi khushi paayi
Vo h hazaaro me ek mera bhai
Luv u teju

abm12018,Tejas Patil,Hottie,,," Sola ka dola, chhayalis ki chhati - you are the quintessential Marathi chocolate boy. It is insane how your voice starts getting deeper as the night progresses :P I still remember your failed attempts at ""something"" during the night out in Singhal's place. But you were partially compensated when you walked uninvited into Deepu's room. You are one hell of an outgoing guy - keep it going.  "
abm12018,Tejas Patil,Sexy,,," Here's to the sexiest husband I will ever have :P  Teju you are always fun to be around and though you don't really look like it, you are actually quite mature. I still remember our Gurgaon conversations and those 2 months were nice because I did have you around. Stay this way and love you baby!!  "
abm12018,Tejas Patil,Diva,Good looking,,"Because IIML has been an era in itself and you have been an indispensable part of it.To me you were treasure at the end of the trail. Though, I am happy I atleast found you. You be the most innocent, stylish and romantic kid. Keep killing girls with your gorgeous looks and even more magical moves. You shall be missed!"
abm12018,Tejas Patil,Teju,Chaava,Tharki,"Teju, I don't remember how came to talking with each other, I guess we were just automatically attracted. What started with teaching you accounts in the library, went onto we having the 1st proper party (remember we were lying on the road), to our awesome selfies, our common love for music and superheros, the Fash P together, to being together during internship, your coming an hour late for a movie to record breaking reaching on interval for the movie, to the epic farmhouse party (I love your cousins), for all our silly fights, for all the slaps I have given you, for all our parties together, for all the memes we share on Instagram, there has always been  a special bond with you. I love you Teju. Cheers to more farmhouse parties ahead, and more movies and more crazy memes. You will always be mera pehla pyar too. PS- Marvel Rocks, DC Sucks. 
          "
abm12018,Tejas Patil,Stud,Model,,"Never thought I would meet someone from Palghar-Mahim at a place like IIM Lucknow. You have that natural aura of confidence surrounding you. Many a times, when I was low on confidence, I did look up to you. That confidence and and amazing physique make you a great personality. I have a lot to learn from you. Be who you are and you'll do great things in life. It was good to know you...  Gaavich bhetu aata parat :P "
abm12018,Tejas Patil,Model,,,I know I have disturbed you in couple of parties :P but still would be happy to see you as neighbor again.  And also hope that many more will fall for your charm in future :D

Can't count how many places you have stood out, as a person and as a friend. The banter with you has always had a feel good element and I can't really be glad enough! Thanks for all the fun moments, the brilliant header, the dhandiya, the dodgeball victory, the Weekend at Palghar and all the parties in T6! I rarely say this, but it has been a privilege and an honor, serving and surviving hell besides you! All the best for the road ahead, my brother! There's a lot I will miss about you, but I am super sure of us meeting again, not just once or twice :D PS: Thanks for the encouragement during the shoulder massages! Meant a lot, even in a lighter sense.                                                                 "

I hate it when you claim you are better at garba. I hate when you link me with random guys. I hate when you run behind wrong girls. I hate all your nakhras. I hate when you say ""toh"" repeatedly till my ears bleed. I hate that you hate Niraleez. I hate how you correct me all the time. I hate how your face lights up when you see kaju katli. I hate your excitement for super heros. I hate that you bring a smile to everyone's face. I hate that you are irreplacable. I hate that you know all my stories. I hate how you are my best memory of Hel(L). BUT I hate you the most for how I cannot hate you. Not even a little bit. Not even at all.   "
abm12018,Tejas Patil,Muskles,,,"One of my earliest friends on campus. It's difficult not to love this handsome guy, making all chicks on campus fall for him with his muskles and pierced ears :P Had a great time on his farmhouse during summer internship. He's one of those people I could meet after 10 years and still get along with effortlessly. Dependable, kind and a hunk – that's our Vicky Dada for you :P"
abm12018,Tejas Patil,Chhava,Teju,,"Teju love. The one who brought me the unsolicited negative publicity in the campus by introducing me to every Marathi speaking soul. You are much more than those biceps and abs. A very good friend who cares about the birthday gifts, party planning and an amazing host to more than half of the life at hell parties. Your child like enthusiasm keeps the energy of group up and high. I love the babu bhaiya in you.  ""Pathar maar ke gira dun kya"" is still one of the most unbeatable dialogues from kasol trip. A friend on whom we can always count upon. To many more slaps coming your way for the hole you dig in my arm and to the one sided lyrics competition. Teju my friend your company is and will always be cherished. Love.      "
abm12018,Tejas Patil,Model,Stud,Helpful,"*Chati Phod* is the most helpful guy on campus. A true friend who can do anything for you. He is among the most popular guys on campus. One of the guys whom you can talk about anything and everything. Some of his gestures for his friends especially during their birthdays are memorable. I will always remember that video. We make memories when we are together, be it the DDG cup, sangram, banaras and calcutta. I wish you all the success in Hindware and all future endevours. Jake k chati phod sabka.

abm12018 ,Tejas Patil,Chava,Sweet,Model,"A tough guy with a kind heart and caring nature, Teju is one gem of a person.

abm12019,Nishant Garg,Blunt,Fine-diner,Warm,A supportive friend who is a little blunt :P ...  he comes alive outside campus when we go for fancy meals... asks the chef to show him the fish to see if it's good enough for his fine tastes :D             
abm12019,Nishant Garg,Authentic,,,"Bro, I am glad for joining remeds, for having met so people there, you being one of them. Although we have come a long way from there. I enjoyed the times we spent, CFA and placement discussions, train journeys Gurgaon times and all your leg-pulling I did. I will cherish the times we spent at campus and outings. I also thank you for holding me and my opinion in high regard always and hearing me out when I wasn't at my best. I really admire you for all the significant endeavours you have undertaken in these two years and truly believe that all your effort will pay off. Wishing you the best and us a long friendship for years and beyond :)      "
abm12019,Nishant Garg,Chai,Mota,,"""Bhai, chai pila de"", this is the first line that comes to my mind as I write this testimonial. It's a shame we came closer somewhat late in our time here. However, we did spend good time and had great conversations. Nestle and Marico case studies, the trip to 'Gurugram' and the discussion about 90% of students here at IIM L are some of the things I remember clearly.                 "
abm12019,Nishant Garg,Golu,,," You are the gentlest person even though you tower over anyone easily and you keep smiling all the time. In Finals,  you showed how hard working you are… I have never heard	a bad word from anyone about you which is a rare thing and speaks volume	 about you friendly ad goofy nature… I know you will strive your way out there… All the best man… :)

abm12019,Nishant Garg,Focussed,Persevering,Businessman,"Nishant Garg (or Golu) is the guy I'm sure will be in some big shot top management position ten years down the line. He'll also drive around in a an Audi or a BMW to show it. He walks the talk and talks the walk. There's no such thing as failure in this guy's books, just stepping stones. He's also the first student I spoke to after setting foot on campus. Nishant has changed and grown so much over the two years, he went from scruffy engineering grad to polished businessman, brilliant!         "
abm12019,Nishant Garg,Golu,,," Golu bhai...It's very rare to find a person who thinks alike, talks alike and does bakchodi alike...It was great fun doing all that bakchodi with you, Irritating you and playing cards (We almost spent a term playing cards only :p). But you have always inspired me. Your hard work always mesmerized me. I am sure you will do great wherever you go. Now that we are going to stay together in Bangalore I hope I will learn something from you. And yeah, Looking forward to recreate college memories in Bangalore. :)

You truly are my best friend. Always stay awesome. This is more of a cliche but, truly if the world had more people like you, it would be a better place.

She is always there when we need her. She is hell of a talker too. Even i don't get a chance to speak when she start :p Will miss you ma'am. BDA class was fun with you.

You have been an inspiration and the way you fight your health issues and yet come on top and manage your acads is something that deeply inspires me.

She's one of the few people who are hopelessly honest and dedicated to their enterprise. Single-handedly pulling off humongous tasks with the most positive of attitudes. Reliable and trustworthy, driven by her passion, it is a delight to watch her in action may it be projects-assignments, committee work, the dance floor or a confidant.

You really cared about everyone in section and gave complete help to people who were academically weak. Your advice helped me a lot in being calm headed ,handling really tough situations and goofups and also successfully passing 1st year. Thanks sushma for being a good friend of mine.       "

When I first saw you in class with your hair blowing around and skirt flying, I thought you could be a model. After I got to know you, I know you're going to be a saint. I'll always remember the times you came down to 12 just to take care of me when I was ill, how you were ever ready for any help I needed for INDEX, how you calmed me down before manac….i couldn't have survived L without your love and care. Looking forward to your wedding now! All my love, regards and wishes!

My 2 year journey wouldn't have been beautiful without this amazing woman. Of all the gifts you have given me, the most precious ones are your teachings about people. Love you...                    "

Sometimes, you get so tensed for small things. Relax yaar, we are always there for you. We always enjoy your company. I just wonder how you will survive without me to keep you from getting nervous :P  All the very Best. Stay in touch              "

I still remember tu mere like kaju katli nahi leke aaya tha. P.P.S. I'll miss working out with you. "
pgp30271,Rishi Raj,Kindest,Humble,Adorable," The kindest, most humble and adorable person, my bench partner, my dear friend. Thank you for being there for me whenever I need you. These long years at Hell wouldn't have been half as tolerable as it was if you weren't there beside me. Our discussions, nonsense chatter during classes, my constant whining about subjects, grades, troubles, and life, you patiently listened and pushed me to somehow sail through all of them. I couldn't have had a better person sitting beside me who understood my issues and troubles that I faced, so genuinely and helped me through all. Thank you!              "

Probably finest of my times at IIM Lucknow! Thank You for all the patience with the mess we used to create in your room. Thanks for being a lovely friend and a wonderful host! That room and those lights will remain a great memory! And so shall your exploits at IIM Lucknow. I wish you all the best ahead. Those who are your friend know how much good it is to have you in their life and I hope you forever remain cherished to all of them. Take care Stud Raj :P"
pgp30271,Rishi Raj,StudRaj,,,"""Aashiqon mein jiska title Titanic"" – Thakur Rishi Raj Singh has an uncanny ability to make ladies drool over him. Apparently this is something that comes naturally to Rishi. But, sadly, a complementary skill that doesn't come naturally is multi-tasking (-timing), owing to which he lands himself into trouble most of the times. His most important social skill is to lie. Rishi, basically, can lie in your face about anything with zero change in expressions.
This high-profile chap owns eight mountains (and counting), hangs out with SRK, and rides in a Porsche etc. etc. But he is so grounded that he makes it a point to never mention these (except a few hundred times in two years) during conversations. Sometimes he might even tone down to 7 mountains!! 
Having said this - To me, he has been someone I could always confide in. He would entertain even the lamest of discussions without complaining ever. Got to talk about something?? Aadhi raat ko banda haazir hai!! He has been a source of moral support throughout these 2 years, someone who helped me complete this journey! One of those friends I'd always treasure. 
Wishing him all the best for future. I really hope he improves his spellings and 'torcher' us less in the future.  "
pgp30271,Rishi Raj,Cutiepie,,,"You are the sweetest person I met in Hel(L). Your cute shy blush when someone teases you, your anytime party attitude, and the way you are always there for friends is adorable!

Over the course of the next few terms, our friendship evolved from him giving advice to me to the other way round. Rishi is your typical chick magnet with his gentlemanly, refined ways towards girls :p The hot (not really :P) body helps too, I'm sure. He's another friend of mine who's been pampered too much in life. Had fun ragging and teasing him :P Thanks for letting me do so, Stud Raj :P"

pgp30280,Shradha Panna,Haseena,,,"I do not remember when we had our first talk but I do remember how during camaraderie I saw you practicing for FashP and I was in an instant awe with your grace and aura. We started talking and you became my confidante in no time. There exist so less people with whom you can share anything without the fear of being judged or misunderstood, you are one of them and I am glad I found you. I loved how we shared the same taste in so many things. We even hated the same subjects and loved the same professors. We always had a news to share and something to laugh on and cry upon. We had so much to talk that we gossiped even during our long swimming sessions. I will miss all of this. I will miss your attractive personality and wonderful oratory skills and your class presentations. Most of all I will miss how you called me 'haseena'. You have a lot of potential and deserve the best of everything. I wish you all the success and happiness!         "

Not because you got irritated, but because one knew you'd handle it sensibly, not like some kids around! Would miss the failed flirting attempts! :D and what dance you do! I will cherish memories of you, none more than the Ambulance in Kolkatta (:P) , the dance workshops and eventually the Prom! Promises that are kept make us feel good. Take good care of yourself. You are a treat of a person! Stay Jolly! Needless to say, we shall meet again.                                                              "

pgp30407,Anirudh Varma,Guruji,FootballFreak,LazyAss,"From being friends of friends to becoming a 'person of interest' in 2nd year, our friendship has come a long way. I wish we had met earlier. Your nonchalance (aka ignorance) is amusing. It was that one all-nighter a day before ConB submission when you let your guards down, and we ended up chatting till 5 in the morning. What stands out in you is your ability and desire to bring smiles in other lives. Adda became a hangout zone because of you, and one more person started watching some of the ManU matches with you in night mess. Bas thoda sudhar ja Anirudh :P                "

To start with, I never knew I would be such good friends with you at the end of these two years but I'm so glad we are. I could always count on you no matter what the situation maybe. Apart from this, you have always been the first person to introduce me to the best movie trailers and also the best eating places in Lucknow. Be it the Choco coffee at Adda, the pan wala shop or the Bombay Pav Bhaji, you knew it all. 
You are called Guruji for a reason and the reason is your knowledge about every tips and tricks of survival at IIM lucknow. I give that to you that you are probably the best person to rescue whenever you are stuck in this hell. Watching late night movies or the best stand up acts, or preparing for quizzes and assignments or be it preparing for the HR answers for the finals, I will miss every single thing and moment spent together. 
 Your chilled out attitude and optimism in even the most adverse situations has always astonished me and has inspired me to retain my cool. You've taught me what you should 
(and should not) do for a friend in need. Thanks for being a jerk and bringing a smile on my face every time.

I will always remember moments together, dozing off in boring lectures, making fun of you saying you would be the most innocent kid in your family. You are one my friends whose company has always comforted me and I felt free to be goofy and stupid everytime. I always had a picture in my imagination of how an intelligent geeky carefree person would be and you are the only one I have met across till now, who fit into this. You are the cutest boy in campus and you have always amazed me with your witty problem solving skills and the ease with which you demonstrate it. I am waiting for the day when you will reach greater heights in your life, fulfilling all your dreams, and I can flaunt he was my classmate and my friend...haha. God bless you !          "

Abhilasha, you are the one that made me feel so comfortable amidst any group we hang out with. You always heard me out, you always suffered my attacks, and always gave a wide grin to any kind of experiences. We have had so much fun coming up with stories (remember **anu :D), pulling each other's and every one's leg, and of course, the never ending Ops classes. Please don't ever ever change.

I really thank that first section party in which I was able to find a gem like you. Most of my memories at IIM Lucknow revolve around your presence. There is hardly any fun filled moment for me at this place of which you were not a part. You have enriched me with countless beautiful memories. The way we used to study just before the exams especially economics, daily cribbing about mess food, random startup plans, kanjoosi waale days in  Europe, sitting in Anusha's room for hours and what not. You are one of the most ..NOOO!!.. You are the most genuine, smart, talented, helpful person and above all the best brother one can ever imagine.

You are the most jolly person I know at IIML and you make this hell a bit lighter with your laughter. Your dedication towards anything that you do is something I admire and respect.

A great fan and an ardent follower of Quora that he is, he has gained infinite knowledge cutting across domains. He hasn't just gained it, he has been spreading all his knowledge stored in his 1000-pound brain through the ""Anonymous"" Quora handle (yeah, he is the one!!). He reads 4 major newspapers in print and nearly 22 news apps on his smartphone daily. From cricket captain to to-be captain to opening batsman to middle order batsman to lower order batsman to 12th man to out-of-the-team to the greatest Frisbee player in the history of IIML, this guy's story has been the greatest inspirational story ever told in IIML, and is being pursued by one of the leading movie makers for his debut in Hellywood. :p Enough of this eulogy stuff!

I believe in almost all classes in which we were together, we were always in same project group. It is not at all surprising that we are in the final 2 project groups as well. I really admire that you are able to manage so much quite easily.. IIC, Qcom, all those quizzes and case competitions. Apart from this, one thing I admire about you is that you are a database ( you know kis cheez ke :P ). Just ask anything and wait for some processing time and there you have the complete information, literally complete!! . Would surely miss those decent and not-so-decent over daaru talks :P. Even though there was a gaali in every 2nd line, still talking to you was fun. You have been quite dependable specially for non-academic things :P and I could surely bank upon you to help in any situation. It was really great knowing you and hope this continues in the future as well. Stay blessed and keep in touch :)    "

pgp31004,Abhisek Pattojoshi,Patto,,,"Patto!! The grand old man of IIC. It was a great learning experience for me working with you for the last two years in the committee. It was great fun having you as a friend and mentor while working. Your party exploits will be difficult to emulate for people in the future. What I admire about you is the calmness in which you approach any situation and then come out with an innovative and practical solution. Needless to say, the seniors were impressed with your selection tasks and treated them as a benchmark for ours. This attitude would hold you in great stead for your future endeavours, in which I expect you to be very successful.   "

For a moment, I thought yes...Indeed. However, the first IIC event, the meetings, and our first quiz event, probably the one we won was SIOM ka Guesstimate (petty 7000!). I ended up mocking you and being cursed by you for the remainder of these two years. Aap ne bade pyar se har daaru party mein kaha 'Ek pee le saale, ek toh pee le' and I kept denying :P But I have always looked up to you as an elder brother I never had. You are a great person. And after these near 700 days and 150 quizzing events, I am contemplating if we should participate in these events over Skype. I'll miss your company and your awkward silence. #PattoWatto   "

Nonetheless (some globe lines), you are Karan of My Karan Arjun duo. I can look up to you for anything and everything I want. I still do not remember how we became friends and became so close; but it hardly matters. There are many things which I want to pen down like your PPO party, our summer placements prep, daily lunch, daily snacks, daily dinners coz each story had something or the other worth mentioning but I am limited by the number of characters here. I must say Juhi is a lucky girl. Now I think it's time to change track. Zyaada hi chada diya teko. Saale tune pure 2 saalo mein naak m dum kar diya tha. You just cannot talk normally to me (or Vishal for that matter). Ulta chalne ki toh kasam hi kha rakhi hai. Bachpan mein aunty ne 2-4 laga diye hote toh aaj hume yeh din nahi dekhna padta. Anyway, I think I have done her part :P. Will miss you re. It's not that we won't meet. Just that it won't be so frequent. BTW just reminding meri shaadi mein 2 hafte ki chutti leke aana hai.

Baaki bhai aage apna lipstick aur shampoo bechega gaon-gaon jaake. Naam roshan karega apna. On a serious note, his attitude is one thing that I admire, and that perhaps makes him stand out.

Rattofying book headings, chilling-out before every exam, being in well-dressed-mode 24*7, finding jugaad for every problem, repeating the same argument slowly and maturely, etc. are few of the many funny things that describes you… You are a completely wrong package of 'total bachha' behavior with mature thoughts.

You are the one who always keeps the charm of our group.. All time ready for parties, excited for hang-outs. You are the one who can speak for hours, when someone needs an opinion about a thing that you don't have any idea.

Along with all these fun, it was really adorable to watch you putting aside all the laziness and doing a real hard-work to help juniors and friends in placements.

Wherever we go and wherever we stay, just know that we'll be just a call away. So Let's keep in touch.       "

Happy-go-lucky is exactly what that defines him. He is chilled-out, carefree yet becomes very understanding & mature when require to. He brilliantly manage to possess an appropriate blend of these. He is the one who maintains the cool of our group. He is a problem solver. Possibly, he has a jugaad for every damn issue. Most importantly, he blessed with rare art of polished globing :P  All said, be the same crazy person you are, always! We all love you this way :)   "

You were our official food guy and selfie guy. We were a team of 10 and continued to be so because of your selfless involvement. I have immense respect for whatever you did even after your 'official' resignation. Disha became more than a committee because of each one of us. Thanks for being around. Cheers!       "
pgp31005,Aditya Bagda,Mr.Dependable,,,"Bagdu !
My co-fresher in the committee; the fresher who makes me feel so much more immature because of the ease with which he tackles every situation. You made everything that you did look so easy –handling crying girls (including me :P),  handling tricky disha situations, sorting out rifts, sourcing information. You are our Mr. Dependable, our necessary condition for anything to materialize – be it planning sessions, or planning parties, everything is incomplete without your presence (and of course, without the presence of the famous 'Belfies' :P)
I have learnt so much from you, including how to post Instagram pictures! (Though the true credit here goes to someone else :P). Our 'Chotu Group' conversations and memories are the one of the most amazing takeaways from this place. 
Many people in this world, in this campus share your first name, but there truly cannot be another 'Aditya Bagda'.

And I love the Ranbir look ;) Stay the same cheerful one always..     "
pgp31006,Aditya Pratap Singh,Dedicated,Capable,Always-in-control," Aditya had the corner seat with me as seat partner, so was forced to talk only to me :P. It was a good thing for me since he turned out to be extremely funny, intelligent and sweet. I think he was my first actual friend from Delhi :p. Anyway, Aditya controlled his daily routine like clockwork. He was the kind of guy who'd make fun of you for getting a 45-min break between classes: ""Haha, now you can't even use that time productively"". For real, he said this. It was really amazing (and slightly scary) to see him juggle CFA, Controls and being a topper all at the same time. If I couldn't find any solution to a problem, his sensible and no-nonsense approach would help me think straight. (though at times I was too freaked out for him to deal with :P). Oh apparently he is really wild at parties but I'v never seen this! But I HAVE seen his master delegation work in group projects, ahem. But spending time with him was always fun, and I was always (not so secretly) proud of being able to make him laugh as well :). I'm really glad you got Accenture, and I'm sure you'll be amazing there. All the best... wish you lots of success and happiness :)                "
pgp31006,Aditya Pratap Singh,APS,Sleepy,,"Once u have over slept or under slept it is seriously difficult to tolerate u. (I think the feeling would be mutual for the phrase ""difficult to tolerate u"" and for me it would be all the times :P). I think you coming to council was one of the best things; majorly because of two reasons (you see, once you are talking about APS it has to be all structured and thus reasons). Firstly, we could not have been so good friends & secondly, you did add value in council :P. Your love for sweets is commendable (Sheshadri tolerating u is even more). Someone once said ""Every tree, every road, every area of this campus would have memories associated with it"" & so is the case with us as well. There are many things which I want to pen down like; our almost daily council meetings, campus walks, your PPO party coz each story had something or the other worth mentioning but I am limited by the number of characters here. There is a lot that I learnt from you. Will miss you re. It's not that we won't meet. Just that it won't be so frequent. P.S. I tried to accommodate that story which we discussed, but sorry m short of space. We still have it in our chats waha se padh lena :P Needless to say, we will be in touch ALWAYS! Love you!    "
pgp31006,Aditya Pratap Singh,Quintessential,,,"Life connected us in Montessori, got us talking in CBS and left the best to start at Hell. Putting us in the same section was another sign, I'm glad we turned it around absolutely well this time.
While our similarities amazed the others, it made our connection stronger. Just as much I wish to reach your height, I also try to match the soundness of your judgements and decisions. You have mastered the art of time management and have certainly inspired me and many others with your achievements. Many of us credit you for our CFAs, academic & internship projects and your perfect articulation of our own endeavours on our CVs ;) Thank you for guidance, support & care in all times of highs & lows, in converting my struggles into accomplishments, and for you being you, least to say, the quintessential MBA :D
With you, I could sustain all the love for Finance, sail through the ambitious combination of electives and have endless ice creams without any social pressure. Hostel 4 & 13 became better places in this campus to chill and study. Life at Hell became better with movies, Lucknow outings, Delhi trips and having the best circle of friends with you.  "

Frankly, one of those guys in Controls I was really scared of (#confession) and was so glad I was not on the other side of  interface facing you.

pgp31007 ,Aishwarya Pramod,Unique,Intelligent,Engaging," For one complete year we were neighbours in class and she was the best neighbour (I had only one neighbour – corner seat) The go to girl for any sort of requirement of class notes, assignments etc. (I literally survived PGP because of her). The person who would wake me up if the professor was looking.  Half of the time I could sleep only because of her – she would increase the height of her seat, sit straight and write notes whereas I would keep my seat at the lowest, will dig into my seat, disappear and sleep. Thanks Aishwarya! :) Someone with whom one could talk for hours to avoid boredom of classes. Her stories of herself and her friends are truly amazing. One cannot just stop laughing. Drawings she makes in class and the comments she writes are better than many cartoonists. Very very caring. I remember going at 4:00 am to her after coming from controls training and telling her just teach me for half an hour for quiz at 8:00 am. She had slept at 3:00 am, yet she happily woke up and taught me. Many a times, those 30 mins with her were what saved me. I can't imagine my life here without her. Can't imagine being stuck with anyone in that seat other than Aishu. You are the best :) "

Its really good that you are chilll/bindaas and consider youself to be always right but then it isn't always the case and so just consider that others can also be right. Apart from this, the pizza nights and talks over it were really good. Probably the only person in this whole batch who sleeps at 9 whatever the case may be. Wish you a great future ahead. Hope you complete your PhD asap and become a good prof. Stay blessed :)    "

pgp31009,Akrati Solanki,Super_girl,,,"You are the super girl of campus. You somehow know what everyone whats and how to handle and make them happy. You are a sweet girl, a super cool friend with a million-dollar smile. Hope you achieve everything you want, stay happy and keep smiling.         "
pgp31009,Akrati Solanki,Presi,Mummy,,"Miss Prezi for everyone on campus but mummy for all of us in our group and specially for me you have taken the meaning of this word very literally by beating every now and then not once with anything you could grab like stick, belt, sandal and any other which even my real parents never did  :P.  Despite of your beating I have always been the cruellest friend to you and have always irritated and annoyed the hell out of you from making fun of Mondelez corp fin of summers to Katta in McK, BCG, Avendus during the finals (But yes thanks to me only that you got through MasterCard Advisors :P). Apart from all this to be honest you are one of the best friends that I have ever had even though I don't remember anything about how we started talking or how even we became friends at first. And you have always played a part of a very important friend throughout these 2 years and had always been there when it came for help and took care of everything for me from scolding for my low grades to taking care of everyone in my party after I was out and also helping Juhi to enter the campus. In the last I want to say that chahe kitni badi consultant ban ja aur kisi bhi time zone me ho tu, mereko farak nahi padega and I will always annoy you.  "
pgp31009,Akrati Solanki,NETA,,,"Madam President!!! If I had choose someone for the role, I would choose you a hundred times again. You are one of the strongest, most courageous, caring and dedicated persons I have known. From our random parties to serious debates, I must stay it was an experience in itself… But I loved every moment of it. You are one of my closest friends here and I hope we stay the way we are. I will not wish you anything because I hope to congratulate you on all your future successes.  Keep smiling and MACHATE RAHO :D       "

Well, I think this is super boastful!!!"" Jo bhi kaho, this woman has handled more pressure as The President than anyone else before, and the poise with which she has performed is perhaps one of the many reasons I envy her attitude. Whatever the critics ight say, I know that she has done more as the president than anyone else could possibly have. Her caring, motherly, outwardly nature towards all of us in our group makes us just say only one word...Awwwww. :p She has listened to our countless abuses and maybe learnt a few :p Still, she has tolerated us all. Can't say anything more. All the best!!        "
pgp31009,Akrati Solanki,President,,,"I've known you long but our real journey started with Mondelez. From sea-side philosophical talks to random conference-room bakwas, you made Mumbai and Mondelez fun. You're the only person in the campus jisko me kbhi mana nahi kr skta, be it tere 250 Rs wale golgappe or any random movie plan. You know me a lot more than many other people in IIM-L. Love you. And as I've always said, Madam president, you're an amazing leader. Meri to ideal leader h tu."
pgp31009,Akrati Solanki,Presi_Neta,,,"Friendship from the start of college days and till the end. You are the first one on campus I started hanging around.. All of our memories are filled with night mess chit-chats, no-reason-night-outs, fun-run chases, fights and loves, laughing and cribbing... together we made it hell of a time.
Most of the time I found you doing non-stop 'Netagiri'. So, good at Netagiri, good at singing, good at painting, good at sports… you can be described in almost infinite ways...
I still remember how you used to take a lead in the first year, like teaching finance to the whole class and even sacrificing your own study for it. That's when everyone started calling you Deputy CR &#61514;. 
It's been a long way, and there's lot more to add to our crazy journey! Keep adding more and more in your forte. Keep being what you are. Just know one thing that whenever you feel low and want to crib, know that me and bags will just be a call away.. So Keep your passion going... 
our friendship and the memories that we share each other will outlast everything..    "
pgp31009,Akrati Solanki,Aks,,,"She is the most helpful girl I know. She will actually go out of her to help anyone. Her caring, helpful & extremely concerned nature is the reason why we call her ""mummy"" in our group. It's her numerous little gestures which make everyone in the group feel involved & really cared for. President sahiba is a great leader too. Another thing which deserves a mention is her ""one in a minion"" room. A well-organized & nicely decorated room with a wall full of interesting minion posters…rare!! I laugh remembering how we both used to freak out over bags & dods. Cheers to the fun we had together. Lots of love to you :)"
pgp31009,Akrati Solanki,Mummy,,," ""Presi!"" is the only word that defines your amazing personality. One person that I found involved in every thing in campus, from sports to studies and being fun in parties to scolding us when we behaved immaturely. Truly a caring and giving person, loved and respected by everyone. Keep rocking Presi !!  "
pgp31009,Akrati Solanki,High_on_life,,,"Incredibly fast at learning new abuses, you have been the most amazing person I've met here at Lucknow. We've danced together at every party from the beginning to the end. And the rare Senate-Council meetings that I attended were fun as well. I hope that our parties continue in the future. Your Indori sev and mango bites kept our stomachs filled. I have never met a person as sweet and as cute as you. You'll make it big in life. Long live cheese. Stay awesome :)                    "
pgp31009,Akrati Solanki,Asli President !,Khau partner,Mast Maula,"So, a few vivid memories...'Main tum log ko dikhati hun Mumbai mein kya mast khana milta hai', 'Baid teri T-shirt chaiye, pehli mujhe milni chaiye!', 'Indore ke pohe ke saath koi badtamizi nahi, maine dhang se banaya hai dhang se khao', 'Yaar ye year-back bach gaya na, bohot acha lag raha'. The emotions with which you said these will always be etched in my mind, and though there have been a lot of bittersweet moments due to some circumstances (hehe!) you are and will be a great great friend. The position you have held and duties you have discharged are immaculate (bolna asaan hai par karna muskil, and I respect it). You cooked food, the asli food, and the tea, dude I am really looking forward to our next tea time adda. I was really glad to know you're being located in Mumbai :D There are not a lot of people who are as strong emotionally and mentally as you. And tereko excel nahi aata toh na meri internship hoti aur na humara (farzi) food hisaab rehta :D You're a star for me :)"
pgp31009,Akrati Solanki,Sidey!,Prezi,Dedicated,"If ever there was a girl who could outright smash records for being the first ever lady Prezi, it had to be Akrati! You're the friendliest and chillest sidey anybody could ask for! You've helped me A LOT during these two years, from teaching me MANAC/FRA to hearing out my rants to being the provider of Indori Shev! No doubts you'll make it big, Madame President & wish you good luck! Much Love!                          "
pgp31009,Akrati Solanki,Madam,,,No one deserves this title more than u...I will never forget how you both made and taught me the ppt for my interview in 5 min...thanks a ton for all your support...stay blessed 
pgp31009 ,Akrati Solanki,Hardworking,Sweet,Leader," It was amazing to work with her in council. We used to sit on the same bench (row) in class in first year, but I never got to know how amazing a person she is until I joined council. She managed the 7 of us (very different personalities) brilliantly well. I don't think anyone else could have done a better job. Akrati was one person in council who will always do the work that no one else wanted to do from Swacchh Bharat to Yoga day. Meeting with CA for mess at 9:00 AM – she is up for it. Meeting at 3:00 AM to discuss an urgent matter – she is up for it. There is no work she has quit on. Fighter! Very Caring! Loved by all! "
pgp31009 ,Akrati Solanki,President,,," President Sahiba, aap toh campus famous personality hain ekdum...but I am lucky to have known you closer than most of the campus..you are an inspiration by how you handle so many things simultaneously, and patiently and simultaneously such a good friend in the competitive life here..tere finance tutorials ne kaafi bachaya first year mein mujhe :) All the best for the future...hope you achieve even greater success than you dream of ...My best wishes always with you            "

pgp31010,Akshay Nimje,Kiddo,,,"We spent an entire year sitting next to each other. Sometimes talking, sometimes not talking, sometimes teasing each other and most of the times fighting. It was awesome and is a memory which I will cherish for long. Saale apan logo ne bohot jhagde kiye. But no wonder I was ur Mummy and had the full right to scold u. Be in touch always.       "

pgp31011,Amishi  Bharti,Independent,Sensible,Smart,"A cute bespectacled girl who has an alarming enthusiasm for steel plants... (""Oh ya, my senior manager suffocated in there, it was really sad... but we get to watch molten steel being poured into moulds!"". Or something to this effect, I forgot her actual explanation of how it all works). She is warm and puts the saamnewala at ease, so it's great talking to her. She's great to study with too! Best of luck bro :)    "
pgp31011,Amishi  Bharti,Guide,Orator,," Of all the conversation starters, ours was a weird one. The first thing you asked me is ""Are you from Vizag steel plant?"". I think that is what forged our friendship. You were always there for me when i was down. You've been my guiding light to find my way in darkness. Having opting different specialisations, we haven't spent much time in the 2nd year. I wish we could've met often. There were times when I hurt you, I am Sorry. I am a big fan of your poems and your prowess at debating. All the very Best. Take care and stay in touch. And please save my number :P             "
pgp31011,Amishi  Bharti,Hamster,Neat-freak,Horror-fan, Amishi Bahrti the hamster reincarnate is the smiling monster that I got to know during my last term here. Her thirst for all horror inducing media content always unsettles me but it's greatly compensated by her propensity to laugh at my terrible jokes! Keep smiling Hamster :)       
pgp31011,Amishi  Bharti,cute,,, thanks for all your help during my tough moments. We have a great taste in music and we know it :P Just stay the way you are          
pgp31011,Amishi  Bharti,Cute,Cheerful,Humble,Meri term 4 ki saathi!! Apke bina kuchh kese hota! Your cheerful attitude made it easy to work on projects with you.

pgp31011,Amishi  Bharti,Hamster,,, The HR consultant...Remember the first time we had talked...I always remember that...Thanks for all the motivational talk in these two years. Thanks for handling my depression. I dont think you know how much I respect you...As u know I am bad at expressing what I feel..So you need to put some effort to know what I feel about you...Promise me not to misunderstand me as you have promised me to come to my rescue when I fail at dealing with people's emotions. You are the sweetest one I have met in this campus. Dont let people's judgements affect you. You are stronger than that. You are the best in your strong area and you know that. Thanks again for bearing this negativity oozing personality..:) People should be lucky enough to find a companion like you and I thank god for introducing you to me. Stay in touch....keep smiling :)       
pgp31011,Amishi  Bharti,Cuteness_Personified,Emotional_Atyachar,OCD_freak,"Miss HR Consultant, if it was up to me, I would have made you write this testimonial for yourself and few other people too. Remember the first time we met, you were a picture of calmness, sophistication, elegance and I was flustered, confused and lost. It took me six months to ask for your name and another year to befriend you. And then we took it on another level. Hours went like minutes, those random talks we had, your Maggi urges, ludo games(which I won by Strategy and you by pure luck :P), beautiful campus walk, passionate talks about manufacturing plants ,Hamster and Otter ki ladai, tumhari cute cute harkate, countless movie marathon and much more. Thanks for making me feel so good. Rimmi, you are the harbinger of happiness (sounds poetic :P ha bol). We had our fair share of laughter(Mine jokes are better than  yours :P). Amishi, I am proud of you holding your high ethical standards when you could have taken an easy way. It takes great strength to be one and I know you have that(Steel lady). You are a Special one to me and we will always be no matter what. If someone ask me to define MBA in four words, it will be you, Shubham and Avhijeet. Just one thing more, it is just the beginning and not the end. Cheers.    "
pgp31011,Amishi  Bharti,PosterKid,MishiMishi,,She was the PosterKid of the club she founded for me and Manish. Went on a lot of campus walks being troubled by Avi and me. I have an inkling that she will become a writer someday!

pgp31013,Aniket Sinha,Most_chill_guy,,,"Aniket, I always wonder about your ability to smile even in toughest situation. There is a positive vibe around you which always make me admire you a lot. You are always full of life and there is so much fun in your company. You are one of the very few people I truly wish to remain friends with all my life.        "
pgp31013,Aniket Sinha,Intelligent,Sweet,Helpful,"You were my neighbor in section A and it was always good to have you around and getting positive vibes. You are a very simple person whom I appreciate for his wittiness, and problem solving approach in the simplest way. I really like your cool attitude and always advising me to be the same. You are the first guy to call me ""Sushma ji"". I am really thankful for all the respect and the company of a helpful friend that you have given me. Your company was always enjoyable and I will always cherish moments spent together during the practice for acts in Camaraderie.  "
pgp31013,Aniket Sinha,Mature,Calm,,"You will find it weird but best quality I like about is being extreme calm nature ( tending towards laziness). Be it badminton match or end term exam or final placement, someone should look upto you for how calmly and with a cool-headed you handle these tough situations.We have had a lot in common: same section, passion for badminton,TT, courses. Real fun with you happens when you are down under fluids. Had a nice time with you.              "
pgp31013,Aniket Sinha,Fucking_chillax_sinha,,, Bro u r the chillest dude i have ever met....thank you for those TT matches and dharu parties                                    
pgp31013,Aniket Sinha,Psycho,,,"I know 'Psycho' isn't your name, but whenever I hear that word, I can hear your voice calling me that. Hence, you are associated to that name as much as I am :P. I should really really thank for providing your back neck as my canvas for artwork during all the boring lectures in 1st year. I used my first Hindi words at you, and you calmly listened to all of that ( I don't think you had much choice :P). We had partied too many times and most of them ended up with you drunk and all of us having laughs. This was a beautiful journey and you are one of the few people who made it so amazing. I hope we will be there for each other in the future too.                "
pgp31013,Aniket Sinha,Tickler,,," Hola! (At least, that's how you address the room whenever you enter one). Lol. So, just wanted to say that we've had some awesome memories these two years, mostly of you tickling the two of us and my first train ride on my birthday :)! You're a genuine person with his head and heart in the right places. Stay awesome and just be more focused ;)"
pgp31013,Aniket Sinha,tanki,,, Thanks for all the moments we shared during our summers at Lucknow. We partied almost everyday. And I seriously respect your capacity to dri*k :P enjoyed watching ipl with you.
pgp31013,Aniket Sinha,,,,
pgp31014,Anusha Agarwal,Anuri,,," Anusha, you are one of the very first friends that I made at IIM Lucknow. We have come a long way from that induction section to this friends group (that I could only dream of). Whenever I am in need of some motivation, opinion or an advice, you are the only person whom I feel like approaching. You are one of the most talented and ethical people that I have ever come across and you won't believe how lucky I feel to be in your company. There is hardly any of my friends whom I admire as much I admire you.           "
pgp31014,Anusha Agarwal,Diva,Caring,Witty,"I am short of words to describe how I feel for you. You the most beautiful woman I have met in life. I was scared that I will be longing for my old friends when they graduated but God sent an angel for me in the ""Shape of You"". (Checkout the lyrics I dedicate this song to you). I was initially hesitant to talk to people in my section and become friends but with you everything was so ""Magical"". Magical that you and my favourite friend Ankita Prayag Singh shares so many similarities. I enjoy to be always there for my friends but you were the only one @ HELL , I could look upon at times of difficulties. There were times when I lost confidence to get along, confused to make decisions in life, even though I am elder to you but you were the best guide to me. Ten years down the line I will not be amazed when I will see you becoming a successful woman working for sustainable projects and good causes or guiding thousands of bright minds of next generation with you as their professor or counselor. God bless you , I will always keep you in my prayers , be in touch.        "
pgp31014,Anusha Agarwal,Smart,Likeable,Amazing,"Our friendship has not been long. However I believe it has grown at tremendous pace along with witnessing highs and lows. You are one of the kindest hearted, ethical, likeable person on this campus. In initial days I saw you always heading to library and being in tension, so I had made different perception  .But slowly my perception changed or may be you changed. I think our friendship began in the classroom itself, may be through events like ""sandhi vicched"" of name and also during group study sessions. You have helped & advised me on lot of things because of which it became real easy for me in 2nd year including  stex. I regard you as good globemaster ( probably 2nd best in our section). This HR talent of yours helped me a lot during finals. Really thanks for that. It is more thankful because you could take some time from time you could have given helping your BFF prepare for GD's. Most awesome thing is your real laughter which I relate to bubbling water. Those ""real laughter"" moments I would cherish the most. I was really happy when we had some icebreaking kind of lunch at amul at start of this year. I didn't want to lose such a nice person & friend from my life. It has been amazing to spend time with you.            "
pgp31014,Anusha Agarwal,Elegance,,,"Hey, you're one of the cutest and the sweetest persons in the campus. Listening to you is always a delight. Though limited, but my interactions with you (especially the Mumbai ones) have been super amazing. I wish I had known you more. All the best for your life. Stay in touch."
pgp31014,Anusha Agarwal,Snappy,,,"The most caring person I have met in campus, I barged into your life without waiting for any invitation. When you didn't knew what to do with me, I settled myself for being your best buddy in campus. We shared our darkest secrets, juiciest gossips, and bestest moments. On times I didn't believe in myself, you showed me how an amazing person I am. You changed me from inside out. You made me bold. You taught me to be better at grey. You helped me chase my crushes. You were 'my gal pal'. I could just barge at any time of day or night, and you would always comfort me with food. You are an amazing strong woman, one I aspire to be. As always, I am unable to find words that describe our relation. This is a cross road at life and I don't believe that we met to be separated at this point. Even if we are, it is only a matter of time we are again joined at yet another cross road. Till that time, and always.. Love you..      "

pgp31014,Anusha Agarwal,sincere,helping,marketing_guru,"I haven't seen anyone who carries oneself so brilliantly. You are truly amazing - the way you talk to people, the way you handle any situation, the maturity that you have while talking, great knowledge and still so down-to-earth. How.. I mean how!! No need but still saying it again .. if you remeber.. you are one of the two most genuine girls I have met on campus. I would surely miss the ""Free hai? Walk pe chale"" :D  and all those random walk pe, cc me, anywhere discussions about random stuff :). I still remember one particular time when you asked me to help you regarding something ( hint: december me when you were going home and there was supposed to be some meeting in your home :P ). Frankly, I was really comfortable talking to you and sharing everything with you although knew some gyan would be coming :).The only 1 thing I regret is the 1st year Index and you know why :(. You always had the most sensible and amazing solutions to anything be it projects or personal life problems. Lastly, you are undoubtetdly the marketing guru of campus and really happy that you got your dream role and without any doubt you will be a STAR! Wish you a great future ahead. Stay blessed and keep in touch :)    "
pgp31014,Anusha Agarwal,SmileyFace,,,"She is the one who will smile even in a stressed situation. Happy go lucky! It was good to know you during Index'15, and I had a great time as VM :D   "
pgp31014,Anusha Agarwal,Cookie,,,"Whoa! I am so glad gym plans were made in Term I. At least I got to know that there is someone equally weird as me on campus. Literally, EQUALLY. We have the same tastes in everything – from clothes, to food, to boys and to ideals (Read: THE WHITEBOARD LIST). We've literally discussed 'everything under the sun'! Two years have passed and it just seems like yesterday. From running to your room to check up on you when you were sick, frantically calling you up for (ahem!) advice, going on hostel-room hunting and celebrating water holi, to people thinking that I only talk to you on campus and to easily misunderstanding each other only because we love each other too much, we have come a LONGG way. You and Hasneen have been a home away from home. I am still going to keep giving FYI's and frantically calling you up when I have to make life choices. So no goodbyes love, you're not getting rid of me! Rest, you'd get a letter!     "
pgp31014,Anusha Agarwal,Opinionated,,,"We knew each other before we became friends but we re-discover each other every day. The crisp debates about some of the most controversial topics or the weird ways in which we humans behave have kept our friendship fresh. And not just that, we have talked about stars & moons and philosophy, literature and art with the same spirits as we wandered around the campus (quite literally).
You are a generous and practical person who charms everyone with her spell of love. 
        "
pgp31014,Anusha Agarwal,Thought-leader,Potterhead,," The thing I love most about you is your attitude. I feel that it is the one thing that makes you an easily approachable and a free person. You rarely complain or pick fights. You are quite talented and yet able to handle disappointments with utmost ease. We have seen highs and lows in these 2 years, and your company has been a pure bliss. Thank you for being there and counselling me when things got rough. As a fellow potterhead, I am thankful to the ""sorting hat"" to sort us in the same section. Thank you being my pillar of strength at IIM Lucknow. All the very Best. Stay in touch            "

pgp31014,Anusha Agarwal,Calm,Miss Corp Comm,," Sophistication personified. Very calm, sweet and passionate person. Handled the work of INDEX with such ease.

pgp31014,Anusha Agarwal,Sophisticated,Loyal,Intellectual,"Anusha is the kind of person you rarely meet in life. Most often these kind of people are seen on TV or read about in the newspapers and to be admired from afar. They are so put together and so good at what they do, you wonder how they'd actually be get to know. Not only did I have the fortune of working with her in INDEX, we also became fast friends between the stressful sponsorship meets and the lunches at Coffee Culture. She is an absolute delight, I do not know how I spent half of hell not really knowing her because I cannot think of hell otherwise anymore. She can debate moral philosophy one minute and then defend the sanctity of lunch in the next with equal vigour. She is the one who is always there, always cares and she makes Hell feel like home!             "
pgp31014,Anusha Agarwal,Anusha,,," You are the calmest person I have met on the campus. Always smiling, cheerful. I am gonna remember all our INDEX parties, meetings, city visits. And yeah the day I heard you talking to those WCD guys I became your fan (Kya makhan lgati h :p). Do stay in touch and keep planning INDEX get together after campus :) :)
   "
pgp31014,Anusha Agarwal,Cute,Independent,lovable,"Anusha you are a doll- that's the first thing that comes to my mind when I think of you. A friend, supporter and fun person to be with. I'm so glad to have met you and I'm happy that I got to know you so much better during our time as INDEXians. The fierceness in your personality is something I truly admire. I also appreciate the fact that you speak your mind and stand for your principles at every stage in life. With that attitude and the right intentions, I'm sure you will go a long way. And of-course we will always be in touch :*

Probably on of the most intelligent, commonsensical persons I have ever come across, this guy (or father or grandfather) has always helped his freshercomm counterparts like us, even when we do not ask for it. The omniscient, pantomath peson that he is, I envy this guy's wit, his brains, and his heart. He is my partner in all crimes that we commit on campus!! Why did this daddu go on stex? So that we freshercomm guys could stand on our own two feet!! (exaggerated?? haha, maybe :p) But on a serious note, I very sincerely, from the deepest core of my heart, wish that you get all the success in your life, and you may do what you've dreamt of doing (SHhhh). May god give you million ADAM'S APPLES more!!! GOD BLESS BROTHER. Always stay like my elder brother, keep in touch.            "

pgp31015,Argha Mondal,PODs,,,"Just a clarification, I wonder why I considered you as arrogant, because you're everything else, but that. Also, not saying goodbye to you. :)    "
pgp31015,Argha Mondal,Strategist,,," You are one of the most studious person in IIML. The clarity that you have over everything that you do is amazing. Being father-figure of our group thank you for managing a bunch of idiots like you did for two years. Cheers bro!

pgp31015,Argha Mondal,Brother,,,"You have been like an elder brother. It's the aura of care and protection which you resonate that made me comfortable around you in the first place.
You are an amazing conversation starter and talking to you is never boring. I hope you sew your way to success with the threads of words and I am sure once you do it would last.      "
pgp31015,Argha Mondal,Daddu,,,"You lack any modesty and make fun of single people. Yet, you've been our caretaker for the past two years and have made us eat pizzas at twice the prices. Despite that, you've been an amazing head of our family. Don't hide others' room keys and make ass shaped faces. Our FIFA matches will continue whenever we'll meet. Long live Arsenal. Hope you get your MBA soon :p Stay awesome :)                  "
pgp31015,Argha Mondal,courteous,shy,practical," We became friends during placement process when we were there for the same person and since then we never looked back. Our bonding grew stronger over time.  You are one person whom I have 100% trust and I know you are just a call away. You were always there for me. The campus walks, movies in first year, MV party, pizzas , we share a lot of moments to be cherished. I will miss you but I hope we both will be in Gurgaon and will keep meeting each other. 
Lots of love,

pgp31016,Arunabh Agarwal,pteronarcophobia,,, It is remarkable how you are afraid of flies but unafraid of sleeping on the first bench right in front of the professor. It is equally astonishing that you have your heart and soul in sports but still perform the best when it matters (Two day z placements). You are always seen in a corner in every party busy coordinating stuff and driving the parties. The bungee jumps would be cherished forever and I am sure more madness awaits us in future. Cheers !!    
pgp31016,Arunabh Agarwal,Lazy_sloth,,,"You are my chaddi buddy, we are together from the day 1, and You were my partner in everything.

Though there are not many memories that we have shared but we will definitely be getting some on our Bali trip. Hope to have this bond a strong one always and wish you a huge success (after altisource :P) in your life.    
pgp31016,Arunabh Agarwal,Planner,,," You are the event planner, the party organizer and the hukkah maker. I cannot even imagine any party without you! The intern at the McKinsey of marketing (sorry for this :P), it was good to know you. Teri agent fees due hai. :D. Be in touch Always!     "
pgp31016,Arunabh Agarwal,Party_Animal,,,When you want to have a section party in the next 3 hours what do you do? You call Arunabh. The most chilled out person I know here at IIML. You are silently brilliant. Your passion about sports is amazing. We shared so many things we liked that we were always able to connect on a different level. I will always miss the late night get-togethers and introducing the others to various scientific marvels like the submarine :P. Always the confident and brilliant person you are and I know you will always stand head and shoulders above the people around you. Lets light them up :P   
pgp31016,Arunabh Agarwal,Richie-Rich,,," Half of my first year was spent waking you up in classes. You slept, and you slept but you still made it large. Your passion for things, be it sports or cleaning the mountains, always amazed and inspired me. Baki, you were the reason behind us trying a lot of ""stuff"". Thanks for that. All the best for your life. Stay awesome.  "
pgp31016,Arunabh Agarwal,GM_Bro,,," He is the one who is ready to party every damn night, and sits in a corner ensuring smooth operations of Hukkah in the party. :D  He's your man if you need any Gyaan about Hukkah or anything related to party per say. I still remember the night when I broke chimney of his Hukkah and had to arrange one on the immediate basis..
Though 90% of the words coming out of your mouth start with 'C', I wish we will get together and live those moments again.       "

That said i would describe you as someone who is never afraid to speak his mind out to the extent you are sometimes mistaken to be outspoken. There certainly some scope of improvement in the quality of jokes but overall bande mei dum to h- be it the knack of counting cards, draining whiskey bottles(Guy with rich tastes), choosing the ideal hookah are things you can multitask with ease.

It was a pleasure to have been alongside him in the Committee. An ingenious and resourceful bloke, no doubt. He can help you resolve any of your concern (well, mostly). I can never forget those late night discussions, and of-course those parties, we had together. Those were exciting times, indeed.

The thing that I will always remember is our late night talks and giving gyan to Bhaiya about our Bhabhi :P (yeh uske me nahi likh sakta tha as bhabs padh leti :P).

One thing that Mondelez did good to me (or probably us) is that they took both of us for internship. Bhai jitna apan ne Mumbai mein machaya hai naa, I ll take that memory for lifetime. I can call u if I am upset and you will be the one who ll start cribbing along with me :P. That is how we are. Will miss you re. It's not that we won't meet. Just that it won't be so frequent. BTW just reminding meri shaadi mein 2 hafte ki chutti leke aana hai. Stay as you are. We will be in touch ALWAYS! Love you!   "

When I came to know in class that you were 95 born, I was surprised but now I know you to be mature beyond your age. From the shocking reactions at Tunde to your crazy dancing at Hostel 14 parties, you have been a super cool friend. You are the most dedicated person I have ever known and I know that you will achieve whatever you set your sight one. You are a friend that anyone would be lucky to just have known and I'm super lucky to have shared so many memories with you over the past two years.    "
pgp31017,AYUSH TRIVEDI,Conscientious,Maggu,Achus," The diminutive the size, the bigger the heart. That defines this humble little guy. He has helped me in two of the most significant ways that anyone can help here in IIML. Firstly, he has helped me pass almost every quiz or exam for one year. Secondly and most importantly, being my classroom neighbour in first year, he was always there to wake me up (for the sleepy kumbhkaran that I am!). :p Being the general secretary of Freshercomm, he is responsible for all pizza orders of our group!! And since his taking over of pizza ordering, our pizza bills have reduced by 50%. GO FRESHERCOMM!! Probably the only person who study time is more than sleep time, he is now found in the dungeons of gyanodaya. I wake up, he is gone; I go to sleep, he is still not back to his room.

And what has that done to us! You're now indispensable in my life. You've had the opportunity to judge me on numerous occasions but your maturity superseded each time. I have loved our unfiltered discussions, post 2-am jokes, and mutual sharing of insecurities. Thanks for making Lucknow bearable when it just wasn't and thanks for the rasmalais, and say hello to Gurgaon! :D       "

Short tempered but carefully controlled, let me tell you even I haven't forgotten the drive to and from the wedding except for some details of your personal life (sorry for that :P). Though I might not share everything with you, but it feels good to know that I finally have a good friend on campus who resembles my brother best friend in some ways (the SRCC factor may be :P) and whom I know I can rely upon. Mature and understanding, I know nothing escapes your observations but it feels equally nice to know that you give the required personal space and never ask questions. Busy or overloaded, it is amazing to see how you still manage to take out time for interacting with us and that too without any temper fluctuations. Humble and respectful, it is always easy to talk to you and not feel uncomfortable. Stay the same. Ab to Delhi mei hi milna ho paega :P iss baar meri treat ;) :P  "

That said, given the fact that this is a testimonial i have to sadly write some good things about you as well. In general bhai, Ive always found your advice to be very helpful although each one of them come with the qualifier of ""matlab tu apne hisaab se dekh le, mai bas ye keh raha hun :P"" and i see you as someone who is a problem solver rather than someone who frets about it (Like me :P) and finally as someone who is realistic about managing his expectations in life.

You are like this burst of energy which is so much fun to be with. Do you remember the messy dinners that we used to have at you room? (Sameer,Me & Melchi chomping and mutilating a chicken in all its glory :P ) and the horror movie nights ( which I was forced to sit through :P ). You always supplied me with the latest gossip :P and never spared a moment to tease me. I thank God that we never let any differences get in the way of our friendship & I hope our bond continues to remain the way it is! I am going to miss you so much. I wish we could have been able to spend more time together but I sure hope that in the future we do get the opportunity to create more memories.

From that time onwards I was rather careful while talking to you :P. But then gradually our friendhip grew and most of my 6th term was spent either out on dinner or hanging out with F.R.I.E.N.D.S. in your room. I really liked the time when we teamed up to annoy someone and the times when in your room, we would translate your gujrati :P. I would remember forever that you ditched me in the last project group of Ad- wrkshp  for someone. huh! The only thing I want to tell you is that you certainly tend to overthink everything and make your own assumptions of what is happening.. which is mostly never the case.

pgp31018,Bhoomika Bhataria,Bhooms,Bhatar,ChotaPacket,You were the one constant thing in my ever changing life here on campus. I don't exactly remember how we became such good friends but as they say it 'the best things in life are unexpected'. A friend who was always there for the help and listened to all my utterance patiently when I was in distress. I cannot thank you enough for that. It wasn't an easy ride here but would have been harder without you. I cannot remember a single class project or competition when you were not on my team. The evolution of 'corona' to 'shining/sparkling corona' is a story in itself. I won't forget the all-nighter to make the #PepsiCo video in the library and so what if we didn't make through the finale; it was an experience of one of its kind. I hope we will stay in touch a bit longer and there would be few more #iTrips on the card.

pgp31018,Bhoomika Bhataria,Maharahtrian,,,You keep aiming high for something or other and sometimes dare to go and talk people upfront. Thats really amazing. Would have been more than happy if that bond which somehow started for a 'reason' could stay intact.

This journey continued with being in the same team as gult team for many projects and as Team Click N Pick - these things are all unforgettable and the same goes for the friendship with you. The one significant difference I have noticed in you throughout this journey is you learning Hindi and dealing with Raja T-shirts completely in Hindi.
All the best Damini and I would love to hear about your 9-5 experiences being a marketer :P!

pgp31021,Damini Gudivada,Kiddo,Smart,Crazy," It started with a common message in telegram, but who knew that we would hit off so well. You have become the partner-in-globing, prof (one day before exams: P) and a staunch supporter during my lows. I met you as kiddo at IIML, but now you have become a strong independent girl. I have never thought I would meet someone who can't even see hero getting beaten, keep notes for each subject and completing it in a term, but then I met you. One thing I admire about you is your commitment n determination to complete a task, No matter how tough it is, you would give your best.
I know so much about you, and I think these three things just define you
Crazy shopping: How can shopping make you so happy?? That too, only in MAX:P
Creative: I hate comparing my room with yours. I don't know how you create stuff and decorate your room so well.
Concept Queen: Whenever we see an ad or a poster outside, you would say they have used this concept so well. Our reaction, ikada kuda vadalatledhu ra baabu. But, at the end we all enjoyed your KT.
My two years at HelL wouldn't have been the same without your company and hell yeah I would visit Vizag just for you. I am glad that I replied to your message on Telegram, else I would have missed someone special                            "
pgp31021,Damini Gudivada,Child,Kid,Underage," Hey kiddo, I know you love marketing and keep up the same. Hopefully, our paths will cross one day. I love your innocence and your helping nature. You are too much fun to hangout within parties.  "
pgp31021,Damini Gudivada,Intelligent,,,An intelligent girl and very good at articulation. Your stud performances along with V in case competitions were inspiring :P      
pgp31022,Divya Malhotra,Rumoured_Induction_killer,,,"Divya, I can't recall how we ended up making our first one day study group at campus together but I do remember that it was sooo fun. Whole night we studied for our first quiz at IIM Lucknow but hardly scored anything. I never knew at that time that our friendship will grow so strong later. We do not talk very frequently (you to hardly utter a word anyways) but whenever we do, we do hell talk a lot :p. People who do not know you personally might remember you as a girl who rumoured to have got the induction cancelled :P, a girl whose reply to almost everything is just a smile, a girl who speaks a fixed counted no. of words in a day, but I will always remember you as a pretty little girl with a beautiful heart.            "
pgp31022,Divya Malhotra,CCTV,,,"The CC TV which is the name I gave you or the third umpire in Bhavishya Cup  (I know the first line that you will say after reading is this line is that ""tu pitega me bata rahi hoon"" :P) but honestly that is the first thing that comes to my mind when I think of your name. I would say the way you looked at first to me was seriously deadly but when I had a word with you I realised that you are one of the nicest person and to be honest you were among the first few with whom I interacted on campus. Stay the same nice person always and wish you all the luck in life.  "
pgp31022,Divya Malhotra,devD,,,"Padosi for a full year… here is for our 2 years of friendship
We have been part of almost all the subject groups in which we were together. 
Thank you very much for being super-vigilant (like CCTV camera :p) during your padosi period and warning me whenever I was a sleep in the class..
Thank you for all those fights we had in our case discussion as they form a beautiful memory today.. 
So let's keep in touch!!
       "
pgp31022,Divya Malhotra,Divya,DevD,,My neighbor! From all my interactions with her I can surely say that she is very quiet & composed. She is very sincere & never ceases to give her 100% to whatever she does. We have spent some good time together. And I hope we continue to share our bond in future too. I wish she gets what she aspires for. Lots of love from my side :)   
pgp31022,Divya Malhotra,Beautiful,Intelligent,Loving,"You are one person that most defines IIM L for me. All the time with you has been a bliss. the Prom Night, the Euro Trip, the section parties, the never ending walks, our TT and carrom games, gymming together, shooting game, singing for you, dancing together, Divya lifting, F5s that I gave you, our photoshoot, our dates, .....Each memory is a treasure by itself. In you I have found someone that I wish to spend my life with. You have always been caring, especially in the way in which you forced me to have meals. Your faith in me has always set high standards for me and given me the ecouragement to reach for more. It is good to be acquainted even to your childish side which I find unbearably cute. I'll reserve the rest of my testimonial to be spoken in person       "
pgp31023,Vishal Dodiya,Nigga_from_USG,,," The ever smiling and laughing out loud (loudest) dodiya. Boy, you always keep everyone in splits with your humourous laughter. It was great knowing you and sharing some unforgettable time together. The first harmony cup tournament stands testament to that. You are one of the achievers on campus and I wish you all the best as I know you will make it big in life.      "
pgp31023,Vishal Dodiya, ,,," My friend from USG. Bro, you and your super cool Hindi are just amazing. Chandrashilla trip with you was great. Even now also my parents sometimes ask ki vishal sahi hai na ab. Hope you grow big and add another Gujarati name to the list of billionaires in India
     "
pgp31023,Vishal Dodiya,Gujarati,,," Hello Gujrati or should I say a proud citizen of United States of Gujarat (USG) - your stories ranging from the kidnapping to the story of people of Gujarat who kept Rockets in hand while burning have always been more fascinating and entertaining than your jokes on which you used to be the single person laughing in the room or should I say bursting in Laughter in the room. The only other thing that has been more fascinating than your stories were the words in Gujrati (from fur waali to thari maa ku saag dhaje) and also the use of hindi words like PAVAN, PARVAT every single day. Even though I don't know when and how we first met or became friends but I do remember we were coming from library together and you called me Gandotra instead of Bagda .But yeah I have taken the revenge by irritating you by endless directions ranging from stubbornness to making jokes of all your ""LOVES' inside the campus (And your love list is a long one but only few were the targets always which you know very well). Despite of being called by a wrong name at first, we have become the closest friends and this is the friendship for me to cherish forever. "
pgp31023,Vishal Dodiya,Bhaiya,,,"You are my first friend on campus. I still remember that we used to go for dinner together since very early time here. MM1 se lekar AMS tak hum ek hi group main hai (we can safely ignore some project groups where I ditched you and for which u were very upset :P). This shows our bond! Your agitation when you lose fun run is too much fun for me and Bagda. You are Arjun of My Karan Arjun duo. You are the one whom I can trust the most on campus. There are many things which I want to pen down like our summer placements prep, daily lunch, daily snacks, daily dinners, our bike ride :P coz each story had something or the other worth mentioning but I am limited by the number of characters here. Will miss you re. It's not that we won't meet. Just that it won't be so frequent. BTW just reminding meri shaadi mein 2 hafte ki chutti leke aana hai. Your 'n' number of relationships with various girls and boys here might come to an end :P, but we will be in touch Always! Love You!    "
pgp31023,Vishal Dodiya,Dods,USG,Pawan,"Mah Mountain Man. ""Mai gira, fir mai utha, fir dauda, mai fir gira, mai fir utha, aur fir dauda..."" Dods the Mountain Man. Bhai aisa insaan hai ki foul smell se do baar vomit kar di isne!! Proud co-founder of the United States of Gujarat, he has done everything in his power to advance the cause of USG, using even violent means whenever necessary. Bhai maut ke muh se waapis aaya hai, re-birth hua tha iska kidnapping ke baad. :p Baaki bhai accent toh puri maarta hai kisi bhi achhi jagah pe. :D Doosri taraf, shuddh Hindi bhi use karta hai ekdum- Pawan, Parvat, Vriksh... Baaki bhai apna consultant toh ban hi gaya hai, make better use of your pathetic accent!! :p God bless you both, bhaiya and bhabhi :p        "
pgp31023,Vishal Dodiya,USG,,,"USG k resident. We came to know each other during the 1 week break and it was super-fun. Your dramatic stories always made me smile. On the emotional side, the way you handled things during the final placements made me respect you a lot. I wish I had known you longer. Stay blessed bro. Plus, I'll always miss your hindi k shabdo ka prayog. And Chandrashile me tu na hta to meri to placement hi na hti bro.     "
pgp31023,Vishal Dodiya,Humorous,Smart,Trustworthy,"I have laughed at your not-so-lame jokes throughout the first year. I really don't know why you were scared of me initially :D  And our MM projects! It was the best project group I had in IIM Lucknow. I had never laughed that much in a group before.
I have found a really good friend in you. The time when we were running late for bidding and yet you and Shalini stayed with me because I was feeling low – that really meant a lot to me. Somehow, I am really not being able to describe you! You are wonderful the way you are. You are smart, you are understanding and you have an absolutely amazing sense of humour.             "
pgp31023,Vishal Dodiya,Mast,Genuine,,"Vishal, mast hai tu! I still remember the first time we met in the library, before we were allotted to different sections. You are clam, composed, hard-working and everything a guy should be. Without doubt, you will do awesome in life. I consider myself lucky to have known you and wish we would have been closer. :)                  "
pgp31023,Vishal Dodiya,Dude,,,"Dods! What shall I say about him :) He is the most amazing person I met in IIM L. We have spent our best times together & he always backed me with his rock solid support during my lows. So, one thing that I can definitely vouch for is that he is dependable. Another thing I really like about him (apart from his insane madness) is that he is very hardworking & sincere. I have seen him putting tireless efforts in achieving what he dreams for. Most of the people only talk while he actually does what it takes. And this determination is what I wish to learn from him. Dods can make anybody laugh with his lame jokes & loud hasi (yes! Not that his jokes are funny :P). And these are the reasons why I am so fond of him as a person. Vishi you made these 2 years full of fun & lovely memories for me. I wish you all the happiness & success. Dhoom macha dena Deloitte mein bhi.    "
pgp31023,Vishal Dodiya,Loudspeaker,,," We have probably told you this, but here it goes one more time - Dude you have the loudest laugh in the whole campus. Your laugh after each joke you think is fully is hilarious :P. You have lot of crazy stories than our whole group combined. Keep rocking !!    "
pgp31023,Vishal Dodiya,USG,,,"Main bhaga, fir main gira, main fir baith gya, fir main bhaga, fir main gira, main fir bag gya. That was the highlight of Chandrashila. Your laughter knows no bounds and your bag of happiness with khakhras was amazing. Keep laughing and maintain your sticker. Long live Gujarat. Stay awesome :)          "
pgp31023 ,Vishal Dodiya,Gujju,,," Dodia…the Gujju of our club…bindaas fun…Teri stories and story telling, dono kaafi mast hain &#9786; Continue writing poems, just like the one you showed me. &#9786;  And keep laughing the same...taaki har kone  mein teri hassi goonje :D        "
pgp31024,Gopi Nadh Dadi,Ipog ,,," You were like to brother to me, always. Right from induction days to volleyball matches, you were there for me. The level of effort you put into anything is commendable. P.S. Anger does not solve anything; it does not build anything. But it can destroy everything. "
pgp31024,Gopi Nadh Dadi,DADDYY,,," Daddyy ! You are one of the nicest, caring guys on campus who always carries a smile on his face and no one has ever seen you with a slightest of tension on his face. The one thing that will always make me remember you is Pernod Ricard and you know why :P and I'm always ready to swap mine with yours any day. Hope that you always have that same smiling face and wish you all the luck. "
pgp31024,Gopi Nadh Dadi,Coconut,Leader,,"Dadi! We became much closer after coming to council. I think we shared the best and the worst times together on campus. You are Goddamn responsible Dadi and I can look upto you for whatever I want. Tu daatega and logic puchega pehle but then that's fine. You justify your name Gopi with so many girls around u and in fact loving you. How do u manage this re! You sing well, and you should do it more often. You might think that my thoughts are hay wired but this is what I am like and thus need friends like you who can make this sorted. Gopi, we will be in touch Always! Love You!    "
pgp31024,Gopi Nadh Dadi,Friendly,Humble,Street-Smart," You are really sweet! How you always come from behind and close my eyes. And all those times you tell off Jay for leaving me alone in mess or for keeping me waiting – are really sweet and cute. You are ever-smiling and always motivating others. You go out of your way to help your friends and yet you are so humble and down to earth. With a friend like you, one could never be lonely. And you are so passionate about sports! It's always a delight to see you play!             "
pgp31024,Gopi Nadh Dadi,Gopi,Daddy,ipog,Gopi is the most chilled-out person I have met in my life. I love how he maintains his calm in the most chaotic situations. He is one of those few people with whom I can comfortably share my problems or any damn stuff. I wonder how his easy take on complex issues has helped me many times. Gopi you will always be special for me as you were one of the first few friends I made in campus. Our marketing group project discussions were so much fun…Go daddy!! :P  
pgp31024,Gopi Nadh Dadi,Dedication,Commitment,," Dedication embodied.The level of dedication you have towards everything you take up. The hardest working Council Member, facing Premji pn a daily basis(phew, #respect), the most selfless Controls guy ( I don't matter but controls does), juggling responsibilities with ease even when we are in the middle of placement season (Still can't forget how much you worked from controls tent during summers). And through all these always making time for sports, and forever health conscious (not even night mess, damn). You, sir, are an inspiration    "
pgp31024,Gopi Nadh Dadi,Dedicated,Dependable,,"What to say about him. It is a story of a rivalry turned into a friendship. Gopi and I contested for the post of Sports Secy in Third term, which marked the beginning of our camaraderie. We have been involved in many activities (sports related, mostly) in the last year. The level of commitment, dedication, hard work and enthusiasm he brings with him is second to none. I am glad to have lost to him in the elections, because I don't think I could have put in the effort close to what he had put. If Indian cricket team had Dhoni, IIML had Dadi. Leading from the front, keeping cool (both literally and figuratively), being tenacious. He has it all. These characteristics are and will be his ingredients of success in any venture he has been or will be a part of. The only complain I have against him is that he shies away whenever it comes to delivering a motivational speech, or any speech whatsoever.    "
pgp31024,Gopi Nadh Dadi,Dadi,,,"One of the few people who like to ruffle my hair whenever they see me. There were very few people on campus who I've seen working as hard at something as Gopi did. He's constantly on the move, getting some work done or the other. He's even got the 5 D's named after him :P The sweet irony of his life is that he's a teetotaller who's placed in Pernod Ricard :P"
pgp31024 ,Gopi Nadh Dadi,Leader,5,Out," Haven't seen a more dedicated person. Always busy with work. He was not ready to make his CV because he felt that doing sports work was far more important. We had to make him sit with us and make him work on his CV. Always surrounded with countless girls. There isn't a person who doesn't like Gopi. Fights on logics. I love him for the fact that he is extremely ethical and caring. 5 Ds framework defines him best – Dedication, Devotion, Determination, Distinction and Dadi.  "
pgp31025,Gowtham Maddirala,Hardworking,Reserved,, Have small conversations whenever we have but they are always fun. We spent lot of time during playing TT and your special smash is very interesting. Had nice time with you during 2years.     
pgp31025,Gowtham Maddirala,Gowtham(t)*delta(t-2),goodlistener,," Hey Gowtham,
Thanks alot for being such a sweet friend throughout. My days at IIML would not have been the same without you. Our countless chitchats and chai pe charcha would have been so boring without u being the centre of it. I have always revered u for ur never waning concentration levels even in the most boring classes. Tried to get inspired from at this but always faltered. Engineering mistake.. :). U ll always be remembered for ur 2 sec processing delay.. :P. Above all, u have been the nicest friend so far,..
Wishing you the best in ur life.. :)
Hope we ll always keep in touch..

pgp31026,Harshil Sachdev,Happy,Easygoing,Relaxed,Harshil always has a smile and a cheerful word for anyone who crosses her path. Exams that seemed sure to be disastrous became more bearable with her wry comments. Thanks for making Hostel 4 a sunnier place :).           
pgp31026,Harshil Sachdev,Sweet,,,"Harshil, you are the sweetest girl on campus. And I am sure many people would agree to this. We share one thing in common, revenge against Aditya for all the leg pulling he has done :P It was nice to know you and we will surely be in touch. Always.      "
pgp31026,Harshil Sachdev,Super-cute,,,"You are cuteness overload, probably, the cutest person on campus! I often wonder why we didn't catch up in CBS because trust me, you're an awesome person to be friends with. From watching 2 States at 5.00 am (because we were too exhausted doing some random MM presentation) to waking you up in the wee hours of morning, running across hostels to dropping off anonymous chocolates at each other's door on Christmas Eve, we've had some very likeable moments! Stay as you are, and stay in touch, obviously. :D              "
pgp31026,Harshil Sachdev,DesignatedDriver,,,"COW ...the word suits you to the core.. you are that innocent, harmless and caring for everyone around you.. and your adorable smile makes everyone like you instantly! You have been one of my closest friends since the start of IIM Lucknow(Remeds).. The time spent in first year by you, me and aditya contains some of the most fond memories I have of IIM Lucknow. You and aditya were my support system in IIM Lucknow. Every exam, quiz and assignment I have appeared for and passed is due to the patience and hardwork of you guys!! Wish you all the success in life, keep smiling :)    "
pgp31026,Harshil Sachdev,Therapist,Hershey,Elegant," Hey Cuto. yes, you're the only one who can track down the reason to my illogical, irrational mood swings even when I'm clueless. Thank you so much for being around,ALWAYS. You are super nice, helpful, caring & warm. Our random long chat sessions & hugs would be deeply missed. I'm so sure you'll do great in life.personal as well as professional. Hoping for all good & happy things for you. Love you HARSHIL baby ! ( although you're the only one whose warm hugs made me feel like a safe kid )    "
pgp31026,Harshil Sachdev,Yo,,,"The girl who loves to sit on the second-floor balcony. Now that we will be out of campus, I hope I wont catch you studying all the time. I still have information that you have more 'tea' with Sigfi people than with us. And you still need practise for thumb fighting. :D"
pgp31026,Harshil Sachdev,Sigfi!!!,,,"You have a great smile which takes all the tension away...keep smiling...I will always remember how u three stuck with me during the placement time...trying to teach me fin..in 5 min...it was all a lot of fun..and hope it continues after ""Hell""..too..:)      "
pgp31026 ,Harshil Sachdev,Sweet,Seedhi,Innocent,"Only in IIM Lucknow I got to know that I have known her since childhood :p (literally – we were in the same school in Nursery). We were in the same college but we hardly talked. Now, I surely feel that I should have been better friends with her in college (may be nursery too). I missed out on something. One of the few people who don't judge others. Is sweet to everyone. Seedhi sadhi girl, very innocent and very caring, definitely the kid in our group, but always very eager to learn. Very hardworking (read very good classmate to take in your project groups). Quite reserved, yet she'll have very engaging conversations with her friends. Has a very sweet smile. Definitely a friend to treasure for life.   "
pgp31027,Hasneen Sheela Shereef,Psycho,,,"Hasneen, you are the most energetic people I have ever met. The way you can shout (speak) at lengths is unmatchable. My first study at IIM Lucknow was with you. I never knew at that time that our friendship will grow so strong later. When you recite poems in Telugu, sorry, in Malayalam :P, it comes as melody to ears. You are one of the very few people I truly wish to remain friends with all my life.         "
pgp31027,Hasneen Sheela Shereef,Bold,Beautiful,Intelligent," It feels wonderful to have a friend who roots from a different zone of my country. It was so good to share same habit of eating rice in thali from hands, without any spoon and talking on endless similarities of both our cultures and planning trips of sightseeing each other's hometown in case any one of us visits others. I also wish if I could ever start and make a habit of reading novels like you do but could not start either. You used to come to me asking for DIY craft ideas and making paintings. Thanks for all of this without all of these I would have turn into a lazy person losing all her imagination and creativity. I do not remember when we started to talk but having you known @HELL is the best thing. I was happy that you did not hesitate to exchange our rooms when you had leg fracture, it makes me realize I have a space in your life. And when I moved into your room I almost fell in love with it and thus I captured one selfie also as my memory. You are one of my friends with whom I can have endless conversation and even the goofiest ones. I am full of positive vibes when you are around me. You are beautiful, bold and invincible and you carry that so naturally without any pride or ego and this make you one of the best person I know in campus.       "
pgp31027,Hasneen Sheela Shereef,Psycho,,,"Partner in Crime!!                               You are one of the persons in our group who can talk about any topic: topics which we shy away from talking about. I like that you put your thoughts very clearly without thinking for a moment that other person may make wrong perceptions about you. I will never forget your flesh biting incident ,which made quiver a bit first time I heard about it. Though you are very open to discussions, but when it comes to criticism of south indian films you might literally kill someone. Hope job does not make you boring and you retain this bubbly nature.        "
pgp31027,Hasneen Sheela Shereef,Bossy-mallu,,,"Madam 'Hasneen Sheela Shereef from Dubai'! Just so you know, I am shit scared of you, still. If people say you're violent, I'd disagree because violent is an understatement. I still remember the day you pulled and dragged me by my hair for good 200 meters across the football field. But that's the case with you no? You're over everything. There are no half measures with you! While you can be this super woman managing NJT, or super stud acing Ops courses, or super aggressive on birthdays, or super super happy when anything nice happens to people you love or super-strong in adversities, you are this super lovely female with a heart of gold. I remember how you cried incessantly when an old lady begged you for food during INDEX nukkad and you went to spencer's to buy her whatever you could get your hands on. And the list of such instances is so long that you'd probably get a letter :P So however far you may be (Mumbai or Dubai) in future, you're not getting rid of me!      "
pgp31027,Hasneen Sheela Shereef,Warrior,,,"  If I were to use a word for you, it would be 'warrior'. Majorly because you have that fire in you which makes you one of the deadliest persons alive. :P Jokes apart. You are a very lively person with a spark in her heart. I hope you keep ablaze and achieve your dreams. After all, when you do that, I'll get a party. It's that simple.        "
pgp31027,Hasneen Sheela Shereef,Energetic,Drama-queen,," She seems exactly like her name. Always has a contagious smile, no matter what. You are like the silence before the storm. A clear hearted, straight forward girl who cares for her friends. A typical foodie who just cant live without chicken (or is she? :P). Sometimes you can clearly notice that she isn't that good at managing financials. Please don't fall for this trap. She has her own startup which is doing pretty well. All in all, she is talented and full of energy. All the very Best. Stay in touch          "

pgp31027,Hasneen Sheela Shereef,Miss.Muffin,,,"To think you are the first friend I made in Lucknow. Over the years from being just a friend , you have become more like a BROTHER to me who is there to do all the crazy things be it doing random stuff or commenting about others you have been in the forefront firing from all cylinders. I would surely miss the way you talk and the very bad advices you used to give me and MD. One thing I will always look back and smile would be the muffin incident which I'm pretty sure we would still be laughing over 10 years down the line. The biggest supplier of muffins in IIM Lucknow. Hoping to eat your mutton biriyani as soon as possible."

pgp31032,Vasistha Karra,Confident,Adamant,," Hey Vasishta,
Learnt a lot from u in these 2 years boy.. Ur belief in self and never dwindling self confidence has always been a great motivator to me. The innumerable pointless arguments on philosophies, the Chai bisket charchaa on movies , the adrenaline rush of us on technologies, Flashback episodes of our childhood are always the moments to cherish. Few remarkable hashtags #SPBalu #Chiru #MBA #Childhood #MARTIAN #Khaidino150 #AugmentedReality #FutureTechnologies #Politics #Chess #Gowtham #Baahubali and this list keeps going on and on.. 
       "
pgp31032,Vasistha Karra,Unorthodox,,," It was destiny i guess that we came across each other. We have very less common interests. In many ways, we are opposites. I am thankful for all the discussions we had on various important and unimportant topics. It helped me a lot in building my knowledge and also have a different perspective. I'll always miss your company. All the very Best. Stay in touch         "

"
pgp31032,Vasistha Karra,LaughingBuddha,,, Your passion of knowing and understanding life is commendable. U have an infectious positive attitude and smile which spreads across beautifully. Ur intellectual actually sometimes becomes over the top because of the deep thoughts and intensity u put into it. Keep smiling and enjoying life :) All the best for a successful life ahead.        
pgp31032,Vasistha Karra,Owl,,,"You are made of ""yourself"" to the core. You like yourself so much that you take pleasure from how you do things. That's a good thing in fact. Trying to be intelligent.. trying to be funny.. seriousness.. everything.. almost everything you do.. you want to make some impression which  I genuinely don't know why and what.. But it is clearly visible that you want to be something..  Your efforts to be adaptable or may be you get bored of the usual routine makes you interesting..            "
pgp31033,Kunal Jain,Number_7,,, The Fin God of campus. The student who would be readily adopted by almost all the faculties in the camous. A glorious future beckons you. This is what everyone knows. But knowing that the other side of you beyond academics has been equally enthralling. A fanactic dhoni fan and a fashion disaster. Our association has been there since the beginning days of IIML but blossomed after Rishikesh trip. It is always great discussing cricket with you and we are surely going to watch the next world cup together. Cheers !!     
pgp31033,Kunal Jain, ,,,"'Sheer brilliance,' these two words come to mind thinking of you. Bro, you have two personalities. The one others know which is amazing and the one Aila is aware of which so much more amazing. You are the guy who has next level swag in everything you do. It's not just me, but a lot of others who feel that will they be ever like you but 'no.' you are one in millions and trust me bro, Dhoni is not that good.

pgp31033,Kunal Jain,Captain,,,Paise ki kami nahi hai MR. JPMC- and this doesn't mean that you say this but it's just for us to say and annoy you. But you have always been a practical guy whenever you are sober and the best brother after getting high :P. All the stories of you getting high from our Disha parties where you never returned on your own legs to your room to giving me the pin number of your credit card to the sharing of lock password with everyone and asking them to stay with you whenever they are in Mumbai which we will always do. Stay the same and wish to have this brother bond forever.  
pgp31033,Kunal Jain,KJ,,,Everyone will admire your intelligence but I am sincerely stunned by your perseverance and dedication. Good to be friends with a person whom you can call anytime for any advice. Almost all of my job applications were actually made after discussing with you.  I am sure our love for Sev will always ensure that we are connected. #Indoris4life.       
pgp31033,Kunal Jain,MMLL,,,"I think we started with our common love for Bollywood and then our frequencies just matched. You were the first friend I made here and one that I cherish the most. You might be the ""FinGod"" and ""Finance Minister"" of IIML, but to me you are the one who barges into the room always saying ""aaj party karte hain yaar"".  I have seen you give our 100% for everything you do and that is something I really admire. You might be all sophisticated with the outside world, but we know the real you and that is someone we all love. I have seen you at your lowest and highest points and I'm glad I was there to share it with you each time. This friendship of ours is one of the few things from IIML that I will always thank for. Don't change.. except your Phone :P       "
pgp31033,Kunal Jain,Gutter,JPMC,Hookah," Co-founder of AILA, KJ has now been banished by the AILA club. Part of the Exers group, he has been responsible for inequitable distribution of hookah smoking time in our group. Hookah de do bas ise, fir yeh duniya bhul jaega. KJ is, by far, the smartest, the most intelligent, and the most neech (peene ke baad humesha 6 feet under milta hai naale mein :p) person that I have come across. He is that one guy who knows everything about the economy and financial markets, hence the ""best"" job on campus (not the highest paying any more, bad for you!!). He is perhaps the only person who gets good grades without being a ghissu (the first person to say yes to every party), and hence commands my utmost respect (dil se bhai, dil se). His favourite spots on campus include gutters, naalas, and dog holes!! A big fan of MSD, he has launched ""Seven"" in collaboration with the best-ever Indian captain :p Wishing you the biggest house in Mumbai, wishing you all the scandals for future and wishing you the strength to fight nature when it takes it revenge on you!!

pgp31033,Kunal Jain,Fin-God,,,"You are by far the smartest person I have met. I have immense respect for your dedication, perseverance and consequently the achievements, given your 'small town' background and 'ghar ek mandir'. We knew any task assigned to you would undoubtedly get completed in due time.You were one strong anchor for the team. You always stood your ground and won every argument with sound logic. Disha parties were where we would 'intend' to have deep conversations. Disha became more than a committee because of each one of us. Thanks for being around. Cheers.         "
pgp31033,Kunal Jain,Brain,,,"Your transition from the brain to the boyfriend is the most amazing thing I witnessed in these two years. 
You went from being the intimidating committee colleague to the pseudo elder brother who had to be party to all my borderline scandalous conversations. The first time we met was in the Disha selections GD, and you scared me to death :P. But for someone who knows you so much better now, you are one of the most amazing people I've met. I remember having a conversation with you once, where you said that you are not passionate about anything – that is the biggest lie you've ever said; because I have never met someone who is that passionate: about his career and his first love, finance; about his hobbies and the sport, cricket, and his idol MS Dhoni; and of course about our common girlfriend. 
Take out time from your 16 hour work days and stay in touch always with your Campus Nirali !

pgp31034,Mihir Agarwal,Intelligent,Cunning,," Mihir and I became friends , when he became my neighbour in Hostel. Though my earlier perception of him was that , he is very geeky types , always into studies and into his own life. It was somewhat true but not entirely. Mihir does get really serious about his studies , but sometimes he just want to let it go off, for his lazziness or watching movies, playing poker and stuff. I would remember our long talks over the topic of  placements and HEPP in my room. It was quite fun. Wishing him all the very Best, This IIT-IIM guy will surely go places!.  "
pgp31034,Mihir Agarwal,Hard-working,Industrious,Talented,"Mihir represents the finest we have at IIML.I don't even remember how we became friends but surely he is one talented individual.Finance is his forte,yes but he's equally an ace in sports.Solitude is happiness to him so one won't really see him hanging out with too many people. Extremely hard-working,he will be an asset to any team he is part of.Good luck bro for your future endeavours!

Among all other things, I would thank you hundreds of times for your bike services :P. I am restraining myself from revealing much as our journey continues.

I guess it was the similarity in age and experience due to which I could connect so easily with you, we have almost always ran on same wavelength, be it ideas on etrigan, or posters or anything. So much so, both of us got placed almost at the same time in both summers and finals. It was fun in SynapsE with you and also in those Controls-Systems debates and talks during placements. P.S. I was there when you were signed out by HUL, and trust me, while my confidence lowered, I was smiling, because it was you. #SynapseRules HULIT    "

pgp31035,Mogali Sanjay Raj,Passionate,Trustworthy,,"In a place like IIM Lucknow, you always need a friend to watch your back. I trusted you since the first day and it paid off. God only knows the numerous challenges we've been through. Managing Aghanim and Placement Systems taught us a lot and it was because of you that we were able to pull it off. If one is good, two was better. I wouldn't have been able to do it alone. I couldn't have hoped for a better buddy. We will surely cross paths again. I would love to work with you again. :) "

Cheers !!   "
pgp31036,Monika Agarwal,Bindass,,,The way we started our friendship or when we became friends is what I don't know but I still remember that our families met even before we interacted and our families made us interact and that day I wouldn't have imagined that I would be writing this for you and we even becoming friends on campus. But it happened and I can say is that you are one of the nicest friends and persons that I have come across on campus (and this is not because I am not friends with many girls because you know that is not the case but is the reality). You have always been bindass which is the best thing and wish you luck and hope to keep this bond strong forever because the friendship with you have really been one to remember always.

Not because I didn't like you, but because you were so serious about everything. I feared I'll never be able to talk to you much. Thank God the fears were unfounded. Today, I am proud to say we did talk quite a bit in first year and more so in second year. Some of  my more distinct memories of you are: our conversations in section parties, our in-numerous fights and your unique South Indian accent. I really admire you for your hard work and focus.

For this, I shall be ever grateful. You even stayed up the whole night when I was hospitalised and never hesitated to help me ever. I've troubled you so much, I know. I hope you can forgive me.

Our friendship has evolved from participating in case competitions to brainstorming about startup ideas to a 'deep dive' into our pasts. I could have such deep conversations with you with such ease. I have thoroughly enjoyed each of our team endeavors – be it P&G CEO Challenge or Opsyrus or HULT. The ease with which you pick up conversations with senior professionals and the comfort you exude is commendable. You are so smart and ambitious. I will always be there for you either as your business partner or one of your proudest friends out there applauding for you when you conquer the world.

pgp31040,Pallavi Dani,President,,, Hard working and energetic personality . Sorry for the tough times in past because of me .It was not intentional or to hurt you . I wish you for the fantastic career ahead :-) 
pgp31040,Pallavi Dani,Happy,Smiling,Bright,"Though we have spent few moments in each others' company, the quality of those moments have been right up there. Helps to have friends with whom you always meet where you left off and with whom the smiles just come naturally. Take care of yourself lady, life has a lot to offer and I hope you make the most of it. Good luck and so long.                                  "
pgp31041,Rishabh Gupta,Sincere,,,Arey Rishabh! You are a sweet pcommer. Few things I would always remember are our late night studies in 1st term and me liaising for placements along with you. It was good to know you! Stay in touch always!!!      
pgp31041,Rishabh Gupta,RG,,,"RG you are one of the few people on campus who were my family away from home! The countless hours spent in Panel Room 2, discussing single topic for hours, creating a consensus at 4 AM when most of the college is fast asleep and running summers and finals process were some of the most cherished memories I had on campus with you. Last 2 years were a roller coaster of emotions which taught me how people from completely different backgrounds like us can come together and perform a task to near perfection if they believe and stand with each other as mentioned in the Three Musketeers film ""All for one and one for all"". I know our friendship ki picture abhi baaki hai mere dost.. looking forward to more pcom get together with you after HELL :)  "
pgp31041 ,Rishabh Gupta,Oye,,," My first buddy of IIM Lucknow…and a forever buddy!! &#9786; tere saath ki history toh iim Lucknow se pehle shuru hoti h..thank you for the so much support throughout, specially during summers!! Main bhi lucky rahi hun tere liye…pcom bhi :P and Star wala gyaan…chalo hisaab barabar…:P ab toh Uber manage karega tu… apne bindaas chill style mein :D Khoob khate raho aur mote ho jaao!! :D            "
pgp31042,Ruchi Uikey,Uikey,Silence!,,The first acquaintance made me make a border to stay away from you.. until we talked in the class.. the first lady on campus who shared the same level of interest areas except one and there comes the end :D   
pgp31042,Ruchi Uikey,shy,maaeri,,"Not much interaction during 1st year. You were always this shy, low-lying person who would not interact much. At that time, could not in any way imagine that we would we friends. But yet, here we are although you had just started to open up and talk freely. Would definitely remember ""Maaeri"" song :P. Had fun toying with your phone and seeing you get irritated.  Thanks for all the notes that you provided. Keep in touch and stay blessed :)    "
pgp31042,Ruchi Uikey,Uikey,Uikeyyy,ChupiRushtam,"Uikeyyyy! As they say it, 'Bas naam hi kafi hai'. All kidding aside, you are the most sensible person and yes the only true vegan in the group (Baki toh sare nakli vegan the :P). Jyada hungame nahi kiye tune aur shanti se 2 saal nikal liya chupe rushtam ki tarah. Ye bhi ek achievement hai. I hope our paths will keep crossing in future and that you will be the same person I knew back in college. "
pgp31042,Ruchi Uikey,Ruchi-Suruchi,,,"For two years now, I have been teasing with my 'Ruchi Suruchi' jingle. By no means, I will stop that. I hope I keep annoying you like I did in the 1st year, as a girl who sat right behind you.        "
pgp31042,Ruchi Uikey,Support_System,Dependable,," Maine socha teri testimonial to sabse lambi likhni hai kyunki tere sath sabse jyada time spend kiya iss heiL mein &#9786; but being the lazy me you shouldn't have high expectations. You are such a sweet caring person, always ready to tolerate me and be patient with me but bandi ko gussa bhi aata hai (yaar projects complete ho hi jate hain) !
You have been my support system here, my go to person and I'm going to miss you a lot (Yaar tujhe bhi Chennai milni thi :P) . Hindi & English to samajh aati hai but your love for Urdu is commendable. Bandi ko Pakistani serials & coke studio dekhne baitha do and she will forget the world around her . Sometimes I feel you and me have so many  things in common but you are a better sincere version. Mujhe bhi ek canvas painting chahiye !
Always be the sweetest one, keep spreading the warmth around  and do keep in touch. I wish you loads of happiness and success in life.  Love you :)     "
pgp31042,Ruchi Uikey,Traditional,,," I dont exactly remember how and when we became such good friends but i am glad we are. I always cherish the sensible as well as senseless discussions. Thank you for hearing so patiently to all of my stories. You are a perfect example for the proverb- ""Talking comes by nature, silence by wisdom"". All the very Best. Stay in touch        "
pgp31042,Ruchi Uikey,Forbearing,Empathetic,Diligent,"The first day we met neither of us thought so can become good friends. In you I have found a friend who bears  all my eccentricities and random chatter with a brave face. When insanity fills the surrounding, as it often happen in IIML campus, you are the only sane and reliable person in the room. Always be your strong, sensible self and thank you for being my friend through thick and thin. "
pgp31042,Ruchi Uikey,Ruchiya,Kalakar,,"Calm and creative. Itni sahi paintings banati hai tu! Even your handwriting is beautiful. You should seriously take art as a career, you would rock it. You are sweet and nice. I have seen that you care a lot about the people around you. Wish you all the best! aur han, Life me chill rehne ka ;)       "
pgp31042,Ruchi Uikey,Sleepyhead,,," Ruchiyaaaa!!! You are the only person whom I find worthy of competing with me in a sleeping contest. I will miss the lengthy Fawad Khan and Harry Potter conversations we have had. I won't miss your constant phone calls with your sisters (which made me doubt if you have a secret boyfriend) though!! The movies and videos we watched on your laptop (which has the worst sound system ever) and all the times we stayed in your room past your bedtime and forced you to stay awake have been the most memorable moments for me. I have been a bad influence on you. The talking loudly, playing games all these things you got from me. Don't you ever forget that!! Love you!! :D       "
pgp31043,Sagar Batra,Smart,,,We have had common project groups ( especially in Operations subjects) and also played a lot of TT together. I think these are two points because of which we became good friends in 2nd year. The fun moments in hostel 9 TT room are unforgettable. Enjoyed interacting with you during these 2years journey 
pgp31043,Sagar Batra,Carefree,Trustworthy,Diligent,"Sagar's fun-loving and carefree nature is his biggest strength, and so is his ability to lend an ear when you need it the most. With his quirky and unique line of thought, he is truly, a friend in need. From ""yaar project group bana liya?"" (one of the first few conversations we had in early of term 1) to ""yaar paper aur acha ho sakta tha"" to ""yaar project ka kaam pehle hi shuru kar lete hain"" (one of his latest lines in term 6), and his more-than-decent CGPA, his seriousness in academics can be gauged. Very few people might know about his campus-di-crush!! Recently he found his new interest in TT (it's Table Tennis!)  and love for different beard-styles (with his 'apna look macho denge' target). One thing, though, that he should add in his armor as he sets his foot on the bad ass corporate life is patience. He is born to achieve great things and I wish him good luck for all his endeavors."
pgp31043,Sagar Batra,Charged,Happy,Sarcastic,"Batre, initially I thought you were the most childishly odd person in the group but later you proved me right! The happy go lucky person amongst us. Happy feet who would rejoice dancing at any place.. 
A person with Cupid's arrow ""rigHt tHrougH tHe Heart"" ;D.. At times which for Batre is most of the times, getting serious for ""His Heart trouble"".. A crazy buddy with a little sharp emotional edge.. 
""Meri Bala se.."" if you don't like this post, I am soo happy to be far off for you to kill.. :D       "
pgp31043,Sagar Batra,Doctor_Batra,,," You are always calm in the class, but when you play TT or when you are with friends you transform into a highly energetic guy.....It was fun playing TT with you                     "
pgp31043,Sagar Batra,A-type,,,"I would never give my phone to you Sagar Batra. Thanks to your overenthusiasm in planning our outings, which would have been difficult otherwise (probably). Howsoever annoying you are, you are a good friend. Thanks for everything. Btw I am never going to forget that you ruined my favorite song. Get its lyrics clarified.      "
pgp31043,Sagar Batra,Batraa,DukhiInsaan,ShirleyKaAashiq,"I'm glad that we had different crushes lol (Shirley tak hi thik hai! :D) Perhaps we could have stopped a drama that started in Index'15, and the ghosts kept haunting everyone. That's okay 'cos Winston Churchill said, 'If you're going through hell, keep going'. But then why listen him? Kyuki iske baad kafi aur president log aaye USA me. However, do remember the bet where Melchi and I both completed the daring task. Though I wish I could go back in time and undo certain things but it's your turn now, and I've got the popcorn and ready to see how the magic story takes a U-turn. I wish Harsha Bhogle could join in for the commentary. Now on a serious note: Itna dukhi mat ho jaya karo choti-choti baat ko lekar kyuki life me kuch na kuch hota hi rahega. You have been an amazing friend. It's nice to find a travel enthusiast, and hopefully, there will be many more more #iTrips and #eTrekks on the card.   "
pgp31043,Sagar Batra,Mr.,Jalwaa,AAg," Hey Sagar,
Its been a pleasure meeting u man.. I have always tried taking inspiration from u for ur neat and tidy room, but again it was always shortlived. Those midnight tabletennis, and those lite moments at parties and those silly discussions on crushes were always the moments to cherish, Mr. Sunny Deol..!! :D
Wishing you the best in ur life.. :)
Hope we ll always keep in touch..

pgp31043,Sagar Batra,,,,
pgp31043,Sagar Batra,Impatient,,,"Like you put it, our friendship can be explained using graphs and figures. But for now, let's keep that aside. It's been good to know you. My time at Bangalore wouldn't have been as good as it was without the three of you who were there. Outings on every alternate weekend became a ritual but unlike the way traditions get boring our friendship didn't.         "
pgp31043,Sagar Batra,Hyper_Type_A_Personality,Witty,,"Oww…teri testimonial likhni hai !
Yaar itni energy kahan se aati hai…pls share the secret :P . All the time busy doing one thing or other whether it's working on the projects, passing instantaneous witty sarcastic lines, searching new restaurants or walking around the campus !  
Gussa to iske naak par hai and kab mood swing ho jaye pata nhi. But that's quite admirable as it reflects you are a sincere person who doesn't pretend and knows how to take stand, rather quite adamant at that. There have been quite so many memorable moments from palying cards, UNO or ludo, it was fun competing with you. 
I hope your search for Tracy McConnell end faster than Ted Mosby (warna daily dose of such quotes will keep coming :P )and she be your Monica Bing forever. It was nice creating memories with you in this journey of helL and hope it continues. Do keep in touch and wish you a lot of success in life :)
  "
pgp31043,Sagar Batra,Energetic,,, You have been a great friend. I dont know how we pulled our friendship through these 2 years. You are highly energetic whereas I am more of a lazy person. Hats-off to your patience. You are the walking-talking Hindi dictionary and grammar book. Most of the credits for my Hindi proficiency goes to you. Those amazing one-liners are unparalleled. Aisa lagtha hai ki you are always loaded with Redbull. I keep on wondering how much energy can a human body hold before exploding. All the very Best. Stay in touch       
pgp31043,Sagar Batra,,,,

You have always been a very supportive and caring friend. We didn't talk as much in the 2nd year, but I really hope that we remain in touch post our graduation.  &#9786;              "
pgp31043,Sagar Batra,Sir ji,,, The way we used to greet each other was unique and worth remembering. One of the humble and mature persons on the campus. Stay blessed and be in touch
pgp31044,Saksham Pant,Suck,0,Sutteri,"I'll always be glad for the Mck shortlist. Before that, I always knew that you're a great guy but we never got a chance to spend time together. Writing this testimonial doesn't make sense as we are anyways going to be the partners of our pub in a few years. All the best man:)   "

pgp31045,Sameer Anand,SameerA,Weird,plainlyComplex,"The friend who stayed as he is since year 1 term 1. The one who cares, shares, guides, motivates, fights too (sometimes).. The one who knows in and out stuff of my brain.. The weirdest person I ever meet (or maybe will ever meet).. 
I am really thankful once to fall ill :D.. Time flies by and so the people that what remains are moments.. You are the one who finally made me start my blog.. The only one who bares my jokes in the group.. The friend before whom you just yourself, don't stay afraid of being judged, whose advise you will take seriously.. I would simply say thank you for being there whenever I needed, for being the morale support always, for encouraging me to do any crazy stuff I wanted, for bearing me in good times and bad.. You are the one special gift that IIML offered me.. :D
The one last time..
The way we met was unpredictable,
But the friend you are so dependable.
You enable the unable to be capable,
A friend like you is irreplaceable.
Though our friendship stays impeccable,
But still calling you normal or weird is debatable.   "
pgp31045,Sameer Anand,Quiet,,,"It's amazing how you get along with everyone or at least try to, Sameer. But yeah everyone is afraid of your anger. You take brilliant photographs, you write blogs, you know about so many things (you have an account on every other platform) – you are awesome. I admire you for all these. Thanks for everything from projects to placements, everything. Your presence then meant a lot. All the best.   "
pgp31045,Sameer Anand,brother,secret_buddy,emotional,"I believe this is too less a space to justify the time we had here. 2nd year was worth only because you were there to share literally everything. You are  Mr. Dependable, I really could trust you for anything - be it help of any kind at literally any point of time or be it motivation/consolation when I am down (which I am, a lot!! ) or sharing anything. The only thing I would regret would be Index and playing that stupid game because of you :P. But apart from that I could never have hoped for a better friend than you. It really felt good that you also started to share everything. Too many things to rememeber - common love for Shirley, all those planning, movies, random topic discussions with ""winston churchill, 99 , sargam and back in life:P"" among the best. Those times when we just sat and analysed what is going on and at the end would laugh at any incident. All those times when one of us said - aaj khana acha nahi hai and instantly the other said - chal bahar khate hai. Going at some pre-decided time to night mess :D. All those pizza nights, outings,sitting at convo, walks. I can go on and on.. but definitely this isn't the end. Too many discussions and trips yet to come :) Wishing you all the success in life. Stay blessed :)  "
pgp31045,Sameer Anand,The_Quietest_One,,," You never know which one has more secrets- the stormy beach or the silent sea .
This quote describes you the best, a pretty quiet person.  But Chhotu it's better to let people know what's going on in your head. Let us all have a peak inside &#9786;.  Your love for clicking birds & lampposts is really admirable (Seriously you are a good photographer) but mujhe camera ki 'proper' advice nhi mili !. 
The eternal love for Shirley and writing blogs…why not think about writing short stories. Waise I've read your blogs  (even mujhe blogging lesson bhi nhi mili). I've so many complaints :P 
Jokes apart it was nice knowing you in this gruesome journey of helL  So always be this sensitive person who has been quietly by my side. And I'm meant to scare people around so kindly bear with me. Do keep in touch or I'll start posting HBR article links on your FB, twitter, instagram or any social media . Wish you loads of happiness and success ahead &#9786;    "
pgp31045,Sameer Anand,Jack-of-all-trades,,," I think the title ""Jack of all trades"" (and master of few) is apt for you. The way you manage your multiple interests is sometimes a wonder to me. You are a great friend, no denying that. You are an inspiration. Looking at you is a motivation for me to try something new or learn a new skill. Though i haven't learn anything completely, I will keep trying. All the very Best. Stay in touch      "
pgp31045,Sameer Anand,Sweet,Adventurous,Nice,You are most probably the sweetest person I have meet in this campus. Thank you for being so open and friendly. 
pgp31045,Sameer Anand,Always_smiling,Chill_dude,,I still remember the jugaad we had tried in first term. It did go well for you I suppose ;) You are someone who is always smiling no matter what.

pgp31046,Sanjay Bhat,Mathematician,Smart,,"'Dekh bhai, yeh toh simple hai' and 'as simple as that' are the two lines that crop up in my mind when I think of you. It is a miracle we ended up being friends considering how different we are, and a fortuitous miracle I must say. I still remember of our ""trippy"" conversations where you would try to explain me deep mathematics, quantum physics and what not. Once, you even tried explaining why the value of pi is between 3 and 4 and not 22/7. I also distinctly remember our Rishikesh trip, the scooter ride, the people we met and my enlightenment under the stars on our way back from Srinagar. I have no doubt you will do well in life, be it in trading or in running a business.                   "
pgp31046,Sanjay Bhat,Bhand,,,Sanjay you're the technical crazy person of our CC family. The passion with which you talk about trading or geeky science stuff is enthralling. You're attempts at making me understand hifi techy techy stuff have always failed miserably :p.. You are and will always be a good friend
pgp31046,Sanjay Bhat,Tallie,,,"You are the most unpredictable person ever! But it mostly comes from how open-minded you are. You hold your ground, but come to agree when you see reason. And that is commendable. Your passion for things you love, for learning in particular is adorable. Be the way you are. What a loss it would be to the world if a character like you is lost.   "

pgp31050,Shalini  Jain,Drama,,," Born drama queen and I know you will say that how can I say this as I have never ever seen you acting in any of the plays but I have seen you acting every time whenever we have interacted. Your hands always do the actions even when we were normally talking and also you being over dramatic always (And this doesn't mean that you are not a good actor as I know you are one of the best). The one thing which I will always remember about you is you after being high and dancing and also showing us the ""MANJULIKA"" avtar. I hope to have this bond forever and wish you luck for everything in life. "

I know that your image in the campus is opposite of what you really are. 

You are one of the most creative, funny, stubborn person I have ever come across. Millions of funny nicknames, random movie dialogues, your dubsmashes, stupid way of chatting, clever way of talking, pretty photographs and lousy statements.. 

To sum up, it hadn't been same without you. Thank you very much for being such a wonderful friend. The memories we share with each other will be cherished forever.

Seriously, it would have been difficult to sustain even a week without you. I remember how frantically we searched for a flat in Mumbai and rejected so many just because we wanted to stay together. How we use to share our ""local"" stories with each other. Each day was no less than an adventure for both of us and I found a great supporter/believer in you.

For all the gossips you give me (the most interesting ones), all the efforts you make to know me, our double date (best ever), to how insanely cute you look when you eat spicy food, to your love for cleanliness and order (gosh your room, I love you more for it), to even your efforts of setting me up with a guy, all the crazy snapchat pictures, your very adorable laughter, your stories, your advises, our conversations, everything baby I will always cherish and remember.

pgp31053,Shivya Gupta,Always_to_the_point,,,"Shivya, you are one of the people I admire the most. You have an exceptional clarity of thought which I always envied :P. One of the first funny memories I have with you is the one in which you betrayed me during Balodi's project presentation. Keeping aside what you did during the presentation :P, you are one of the most sincere and hardworking people I have ever met. You are one of the very few people I truly wish to remain friends with all my life.         "
pgp31053,Shivya Gupta,Unpredictable,sweet,,"Very interesting friend.  Of all, I have never been able to judge your nature. However one thing I am sure of is that you are a very sweet and good natured person. I enjoyed doing group studies with you, Sunaina and Aniket. It was really fun seeing people who are more lazy than me.  I remember when you used to get high on sleep during group studies. You,me and sunaina ended up playing some rubbish games like ""Chiku liba"". I should also accept and you also know I fear you the most in case of any wrongs. One quality (which I may be incorrect)  matches with you is our underconfidence.. It is you whom I like teasing the most, because you get irritated the most. I had a real good time with you.         "
pgp31053,Shivya Gupta,Quietest,,, The quietest person I have ever come across with and who just says the things only when it matters. And to be honest you are the only person whom I have seen laughing more than talking. Stay the same with the smiling face and wish you all the luck in life. 
pgp31053,Shivya Gupta,Boondi,,,"I still wonder why we didn't talk to each other during the entirety of the first year. I don't think there can be two people any more different than the two of us, still we just seem to somehow connect like two pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. Your simplicity is something that sets you apart from the crowd – don't change for anyone. Your caring nature makes you such a good friend that people are always willing to confide in you – I'm no different. People who have come to know you, treasure you – so do I. Our friendship over the past year has been a roller coaster ride, but what's the fun in driving on a straight road. Here's to the promise of an everlasting friendship – no matter what!!! "
pgp31053,Shivya Gupta,Sister,,," Bro, you're the best thing that has happened to me in IIM-L. You literally know each and everything about me. Life would have been very tough without you. I know we'll stay like this forever but one thing I'll surely miss is being with the after-2 version of you. Love you&#61514;       "
pgp31053,Shivya Gupta,Neurotic,,,"One of the most bold people I have met, I have huge respect for you girl. I admire the way you selfless act for other, the way you always take care of people, the way you won't ever let me eat alone, the way you hug me when I am happy or sad, and many more million ways I cannot describe by words. You do realize I cannot use this space to explain what you are to me or what person you are to the world. I don't want a trip down the memory lane, because you know I would end up in tears if I do that. Let me say this, my bold beautiful girl, I am sorry I wasn't there always for you. I am not a person who has many regrets, but this is one. And if I could get a chance to relive the moments again, I definitely want to change that. I don't want to miss you, so be there for me too..always...             "
pgp31053,Shivya Gupta,Awesome,Sweet,,"My favorite last bencher, how could I not write a testimonial for you! ""Cool ya"", ""so bad yaa"", ""not done yaa"" are some of the lines that echo in my mind when I think of you. I feel lucky to have had the chance to know you, although I would have loved to have known you more. Do well, stay this awesome, always. Be in touch :)     "

I remember, most of our discussions were within those boring class hours and I really enjoyed the time with you. Time went by like wind in these two years.
You are such a nice person… Peaceful at heart… Sensible, Sincere and a bit naively Innocent. You will forever be remembered for ur great fashion sense (curtain & bedsheet prints).. :D :D. Hahaa, I guess I have intimidated u alot on this and I still remember u crying when u heard this :D. Sorry for the devil smile. Thanks for being such a sweet friend throughout.

pgp31053,Shivya Gupta,Soul-sister,,,"Hey best friend, did you just got a knock on your door, well that can be me. But stop. Read this before you get up to do anything else. It has been two years of sharing an awesome bond. We have laughed, cried, ate, worked, prepared for quizzes and shared almost everything. It is a soul-sister like relationship and is a bouquet of happiness in my life. You are my confidante and you know me so well that you would know my mood by the kind of WhatsApp messages I send. #rolling eyes!
I love you for all your things you tell, for watching movies only because I wanted to, for dancing in the room because you know that makes me happy and for all your support. It is adorable how you ardently checked on me during placements, ensuring everything was in place; you waited for hours outside the interview room for me. It is endearing to have a friend who cares like family.
We have fought countless times and it deepened our bond. We became each others' strength. We know that if anything ever goes wrong the other shall always be there. 
Let us stay best friends forever.
        "
pgp31053,Shivya Gupta,Reliable,,,"Hey DODO, among many others :P , I would like to thank you for being that matured friend who always helped me gain confidence that I would do well, especially during critical times. Of course, that is what is expected out of you being from Team Disha. I completely admire your efforts for helping out others and bringing the best out of them. Ours is a crazy journey, especially in the second year, being in the same project team in almost all subjects and doing last minute stuffs. Adding to these are the craziest yoga sessions. All the very best Shivya, I would never forget these crazy stuffs! :)      "
pgp31053,Shivya Gupta,Guide,Compassionate,," I think the word ""Di"" sums up everything i want to say... We met, it was luck. We talked, it was chance. We became friends, it was destiny. We are like siblings, it is faith. You will always be my sister, it is a promise... Though we might fight or go without talking to each other for a long time, remember that I will always be there when you need me. All the very Best. Stay in touch    "
pgp31053,Shivya Gupta,2 weeks,,," I have the coolest memories with you. Our breakfast rituals, our walks, secret missions, your KT sessions, our chocolate indulgence, hair care habits, bathroom nagging, sun bathing, white board drawings, bad seriously injurious song humming and there are so many more things. Thank you for being 4 rooms away. Thank you for being such a safe haven for me – I know that I can share anything with you and the cute part is that I don't think this can change. It is surprising that for the second time in our lives we would have been in the same college and wouldn't have talked to each other – I think it's you – why don't you talk man? (sarcastic, evil grin). You have dealt with me with all the patience and perseverance that your extra-terrestrial kind could have shown – you are not from Earth – you are unnaturally happy seeing balloons!! I know that you have a sleeping disorder where you end up sleeping unbelievably easily anywhere, stop it woman! Just go easy with the hyena like giggle or is it more horse like?
Hope you have a stellar life. I wish the best for you and more. I am not writing anything else – I don't even like you – you are weird!
"
pgp31053,Shivya Gupta,Understanding,Caring,Well,"I owe you for understanding the situation well and giving me and Sunaina the required time to spend with each other. Though we never interacted much, we only came closer during the placement week and hope that understanding increases with time.  All the best for future!! "
pgp31053,Shivya Gupta,my_committee_bestie,,,"The doe-eyed beauty was my guide and confidante in the committee. Shivya, your presence made so much so bearable in the campus. Your reassuring smile and the forever calm behaviour helped calm down my nerves many a times. I really thank Disha for the chance to be your friend :) Will miss our selfies in Disha outings :D Wish your truckloads of happiness!                  "
pgp31053,Shivya Gupta,TemporaryRoommate,Sweetness,,"You have been the silent contributor all this while – contributing your bit as a Disha member or contributing your share of happiness and joy in my life. It was in Mumbai that we bonded - sharing an apartment or dealing with your tantrums over food or making you laugh while you are on a professional call – everything is a testimony to our friendship. The only thing I have failed at was making you dance. I am just a call away whenever you need me, bro. So glad to have had you on the team. Cheers to D31!                    "

pgp31054,Siddharth Agarwal,Siddharth,,, You are a true pcommer. Chill and responsible at the same time; it was really good to know you! You were the savior many times to make sure that APS gets up for the meetings. Agar tu Mumbai mein hai toh we will definitely have fun. Stay in touch!     
pgp31054,Siddharth Agarwal,Awesome,,,"From being the best party host on campus to the best person to understand cases and articles from, at night before any exam – you are truly a Jack of all trades. Meeting you in remeds was a pleasure, ending up in same section was a blessing – since then you have been my 'Core team' and 'Fantastic Four'. And then, 'Pizza' helped satisfied the appetite as well as had my back in the most crucial times and decisions. I have learnt so much from you, yet it be a fraction of all that's there in your processor. Thank you for your endless support, guidance and care; for being there for everyone at all times – placement preps, gyaan sessions and ice cream treats to name the absolute few! I will always cherish the time we spent - all the hostel chill scenes and outings, the serious-fun discussions and surely all the pampering I got. Stay the awesome self :D      "

I adore the way you've been the glue holding all of us together. From being the best party host to being the sensible advisory friend I'm sure HelL wouldn't have been as fun without you. I don't need to wish you luck for your future endeavors,because I'm sure your gonna rock it anyway. Your Pcomm Skills ;) May great things follow here on. Siddie, I'll miss you.    "
pgp31054,Siddharth Agarwal,Teji-mein-bhai,,,"From Partycomm to the last days at IIML, you have been the glue that holds this family together. You are the 'responsible' one in our IIML family. Whatever it is you are always there. Your \m/ with a smiling nod of head was one the cutest thing ever. Beyond everything, you were there for anyone in this family who needed you. And also how we loved pulling panda's leg together! Baba, you are beautiful.     "

pgp31054,Siddharth Agarwal,PCom,,," Some call him Mona Lisa, and he knows why!! Siddharth is one of the most supportive and motivating people I've met in the last few years. He was the first person I met when I arrived at the institute and still remains one of the closest friends.   "
pgp31054,Siddharth Agarwal,Thakur,Sleepy,Que Sera Sera," SD! You are the coolest person in pcom. Bindass and chill is how I would describe you. That's why you are concap, sir! You ran really smooth processes, for one. Your abuses are very Jhaatu and I really enjoy the dance steps which you create - *The one which looks like we are punching at a little kid with each hand one by one* You are the oldest, ahem ahem, but still a kid sometimes! :D You are gonna rock at Deloitte, my friend. Yoo!"
pgp31054 ,Siddharth Agarwal,PlaceCom,Big,Party,"Someone who loves to party. He will share endless funny incidences from his IIT BHU days or his IBM days and keep the gathering cheerful. Big brother to a lot of people on campus, always looking to help them in any way possible. Giving advice and tips to people. Quite resourceful too (7/10). If you want something to be done, call him – he ""might"" be able to help. Do what you want, but if you didn't call him, surely don't tell him about the hardship that you faced to get something done. Else, he'll spend the next half an hour ""trying"" to take your case and prove that he would have gotten it done in 2 mins. An amazing friend to treasure for life.  "
pgp31055,Siddharth  Arun,Go-to-man,,," You are the king of goof-ups, the butt of many jokes and the source of humorous content. But, I guess everyone would agree, the life at campus would have been so less entertaining without you. You have innate quality to be the first one to come forward for help. For me, you are the source of best movies, the companion for Tunday outings, the endless cricketing talks and the go-to-man for any anything good or bad. You have made bold decisions in your life and I am sure that you will be rightly rewarded. Don't miss out on the World cup 2019 plan. Cheers !!    "

Kuwaiti Bro When I try to remember the first thing about you, all I can see is a guy sitting on the last bench sleeping dead in the class. The boy who gave no fucks to the class but still was brave enough to take the set most difficult electives possible. Have a great life ahead bro.
    "
pgp31055,Siddharth  Arun,Sarun,Goof-up,, The goof-up master who has done I don't remember how many goof-up's from football to cricket to our daily talks and have always given us a chance to make fun and annoy you which you have always taken in a positive manner which has been the best thing. I remember the first time we met I thought you were some khadoos senior but turned out to be my classmate and then turned out a great friend. Thank you for all this campus fun that you gave to all the AILA+ members. Stay the same and rock in Al-Habibi style. 
pgp31055,Siddharth  Arun,SArun,,,Kaafi maze liye hai tere 2 saal mein. But you never retaliated. It was good to know you. Your football skills are amazing (Sorry :P). Stay as you are. Be in touch!     
pgp31055,Siddharth  Arun,Sarun,Siddhu,Hagga," Sarun, the king of goof-ups, his answer to his personal goof-up exceeds a million words!! Jitna isne haga hai utna kisi ne nai haga. He has been a proud ""National-Level"" hockey, football and cricket player. He has also ventured into coaching these sports, with his biggest highlight being the personal coach of Navjot Singh Siddhu! He was also the coach of the Indian national hockey team for more than a decade, having guided the team to second-round once. :p Words are not enough to express India's sincere gratitude towards our veteran, Mr. Sarun. On a serious note, he is one of the most helping persons around the campus and has always been willing to lend a helping hand, even when not asked for (and that sometimes gets him in trouble :p). Baaki bhai apna sone ke bhaaw tul chuka hai, jald hi nikaah hone waala hai iska!! He is also the proud owner of an oil well in Kuwait, and has made deals with numerous Kuwaiti Princes. With his job posting in Kuwait, many suspect what the future holds for Kuwait with Sarun's permanent arrival in that country.        "

We knew each other more and more during Nainital trip. One things that I definitely vouch for you is that you are the guy I can always depend on for any middle-of-the-night crisis. I am glad I met u. You are the reason for many of the funniest moments that we'll laugh on after years and years.   "

Bring home some oil when you come back. Make Indian great again. Al Habeebi ! Stay awesome :)             "

Your skills (also your deep knowledge about vitamin content of any random food item :P) always fills me with awe. I think our friendship started during Balodi's SM project and since then it has grown exponentially. If I start counting the friends I trust the most, then you will be in my hotlist. You have always been a very supportive friend. Though you do lie at times, saying things like I forced you to watch Deadpool etc. etc. etc. but still I consider you one of the best friends I have ever made. You are one of the very few people I truly wish to remain friends with all my life.         "
pgp31056,Sunaina Narender Kumar,Multitalented,sweet,,"One of the most quiet natured of all my friends. Intitally I had a misconception that you are arrogant, but slowly realised that you dont talk much with most of the people and talk to only select few. I feel obliged to be one of them. You are very sweet,polite and I admire you for the multiple talents you have- dance,paint,sports. I remember the fun we had during group studies. I remember you using my body as canvas to do your painting. You are like a sister to me and I could relate even more to it owing to recent events. Had a fun time interacting with you.            "
pgp31056,Sunaina Narender Kumar,Cheerful,Sweet,Great,"Sunaina was my wingie for a year. We studied together, had pizza parties, tried to help each other out on rubbish projects... I like that she always tried to maintain a balance in life by doing yoga, playing sports and taking walks. She was always up for a walk. [I remember taking a long walk with her where we tried to recount the Mahabharat and I wasn't as good at Indian mythology as I thought I was :p]. Thank you for all the back massages, they seriously saved my life :) Anyway, :*              "
pgp31056,Sunaina Narender Kumar,Saddist,,,"As promised, I have used 'the defining word' for you. Well, you happily threatened me to feed to the dogs, that says everything :P ... My wonderful artist dancer friend, I think it took time for us to get acquainted to each other. But once we did, there was no stopping us. I know what makes you excited, and what makes you tickled (like literally :P). You stood by me no matter what, and I hope I was also that kind of friend to you. You are a person with lots of charm, color, and richness. I want you to use it to paint your life the exact way you want. I remember our conversation about Medussa, how beautifully you explained your thoughts. The spark in your eyes when you talked about that, I want you to have that spark always and forever... Know this, I will be there for you just a phone call way... I will miss you terribly... PS: Wear the Kerala saree for my wedding :D                "

pgp31056,Sunaina Narender Kumar,free_spirited,philosopher,dancing_dolphin,"Our friendship curve if drawn would truly fit a perfect normal curve. Started in 2nd sem and gradually became good friends by the end of 3rd sem. The best part was during Summers. Really had a great time there including all those random outings and movie plans. This bond was strengthened by the walks on campus that I truly enjoyed as you probably were the only one who matched my speed :P. Then there were all those truly interesting philosophical discussions about what not. Still remember that ""A girl needs a face"" and ""5 things to do"" discussions. Also ""it's all about the perspective"" multiple discussions with no conclusion. Although quite shy by nature but as and when you get to know more, this aspirational (art store), free-minded girl , naive and innocent at heart, fun to be with. You were one of the few people I missed during Stex specially for walk-discussions. But then came 6th term and something which I wish should not have happened. I sincerely want that atleast you take care about that in the future. I hope we continue our good friendship for the time to come.  I am sure that you will have a wonderful life ahead. Keep in touch and do remember to check-off everything in the 5 year things to do list :D Stay blessed :)    "
pgp31056,Sunaina Narender Kumar,Shining-star,,,"Hi love! What I feel for you cannot be described in words. You're my constant! I cannot imagine how IIM L would be without you. We've shared everything, literally everything – from bed & blankets and toothpaste to family discussions and heart musings. We've practically (for a lack of better and proper word) 'lived' together. We were together for mostly all meals and almost all classes, yet you never grew tired of me. Thanks for bearing with my nuisances (I know there were many) and many more thanks for taking care whenever, and however, you could of me. I love you for what you were in the first year, and more for what you've become. Dearest girlfriend, you've become this endearing human, whom people cannot help, but love! And just so you know, you're not getting out of this relationship now! XOXO       "
pgp31056,Sunaina Narender Kumar,Honest,,,"We are the backbenchers of the section-A!! I would never forget your nautanki and leg fights sitting in the last bench of CR-108. You are that one person in this campus whose door I can knock at 24*7*365 and ask for any help I want. I feel it makes sense for me to admit at least now that I am proud of having the most multi-talented friend who knows everything starting from dance, arts to sports and has a special interest in Badminton :P. I never thought I would attend classes taken by kids and most importantly you as the yoga guru for me and Shivya. 
All the best Sunaina and I would love to see you ""growing up"" like a banker. Finally, don't forget that your beLOVEd ones used to admire you like ""Naina O Naina….""

pgp31056,Sunaina Narender Kumar,Mystery,Barbie,," The first time I saw you is in the first insti party we had. You seemed so silent, but little did I know that you are a bomb about to go off. A very talented person, amazing dancer and even more amazing painter. For a person who talks a lot, I actually am falling short of words today. I mean it. You are more matured than you know. She is a combination of emotions and craziness, always at extremes. All the very Best. Stay in touch   "
pgp31056,Sunaina Narender Kumar,Helpful,Reliable,Sensitive,"My ultimate repository of secrets…a place where I know they would be safely guarded and protected from the others! How destiny brought us together from having a mutual friend to becoming hostel mates to travelling this MBA journey together! It is difficult to imagine my survival in this place without you. Belittled, abandoned and you know the rest….you came, you stayed, you understood, you helped, you were a constant companion I could look up to. Born different, we are bound to have our differences of opinions but what mattered and will still continue to is how I can still feel that you will be there even if we are not talking. A person with whom even silence is understood, in whose company I can feel safe and protected. Away from the hustle and bustle of the IIM world, it was amazing to see how we managed to create our own world in our rooms, locked in company – behaving as if things never happened, as if the world does not exist. All the first year memories are still fresh in my mind and I hope that they will be in yours too everytime you read this. I am happy that we will be in the same city hopefully!! (I don't know if we need this….but yes thanku for everything)  "

I don't know of anyone who has been this chill about anything in life. Especially group projects! You're so smart, and again, chill about everything, that we'd be calm if you were in our project group. You have been a savior so many times! And your sense of humor has been bang on. Loved every moment I spent with you!        "

Sometimes goes cute with her child like behavior but most of the time you will find her standing hands on waist.. The terror pose for all around her.. The suruchi mode..!! The acting Missandei to all unsullied..
I always wondered why did I ended up hanging around with a person who is totally opposite to what I am..? The reason my heart shout is ""because the soul and heart behind that introvert person matters..""
If you don't like this post, I am sooo happy to be more than one hand distance away.. :D  "
pgp31058,Suruchi Gunjan,Reticent,,,"Your friendship is one of the most cherished things that I would be taking back from this campus. The time we spent together in library, strolls in campus, gossips, arguments, shopping and so much more was fun. You are one of those made this a livable place for me. The bond that has been built in these two years is never going to fade. Stay in touch. I would miss you.    "
pgp31058,Suruchi Gunjan,hadd_allsi,pagli_jhalli,poltergeist,"The most laziest person I have met :P  You have truly redefined the definition of laziness. It was always real fun irritating you in any way possible specially by correcting your hindi :D. But generally had fun hanging with you. Although I do take care what I say to you after that ""I will never forget this"" incident with someone else :). You do keep a ""grudge"" which is not good.. try to ignore things nahi to wahi dhundne ke liye bhagna padta h.. kitni mehnat lagti h usme :P. Wo song ""pagli jhalli"" was surely made for you. Also, remember poltergeist.. that was such a blunder on the grandest stage of all time .. that one incident I am definitely not going to forget. We do had some things in common.. be it horror movies or no nonsense .. yes as you said we are namune in our own way.. different from most of the others. I hope that we are able to go forward with our south trip plan soon. Hope our friendship continues after IIML as well. Stay blessed and keep in touch :)    "
pgp31058,Suruchi Gunjan,Gunnnnu,ShantLadki,ChennaiExpress,"Amidst chaotic MBA life (includes classes and placements) lived this super calm and quiet girl. Little passive by nature who make cute faces and baby voices to ask you to do chores so that she can continue being lazy. If behaved nicely she will be as sweet as 'gujiya' but keep making mistakes, and beyond a point, she can be as scary as 'samara'. I am lucky enough to witness both your side. A voracious reader who perhaps love books more than anything in her life. She invariably makes sense when conversing, and it always feels nice to talk to her. Suruchi Gunjan, You have been a great friend to me in the time I have met you. I hope you have an incredibly happy life. Please, please stay connected :')   "
pgp31058,Suruchi Gunjan,Dreamy,,," Apni dhuniya mai koyi rahthi hai. She seems so innocent and silent. Once you get to know her, she is a whole different person. Highly talented.

Whether it was copying assignments, studying supply chain management together (at which I think you are really good), making overtures video for my dance club, you were that one person to reach out for help. I do not remember exactly when we talked first and became friends but one thing I will always remember. And that is, you have never said ""No"" to anything for help that I have asked for. There were times I have panicked when any problem arises but you have always amazed me with the CHILL MODE you are always in. …I wish I could be at least a bit like you and learn how to enjoy life with no worries and carry a smile. Thanks a lot from the deepest of my heart for being there always for me and making my life @ HELL memorable comprised of memories of a friend like you with a ""Golden heart"".    "

You have been an awesome friend and I am glad that we were able to spend so many great moments together. Melchi, I always looked at you as a sweet little kiddo lost in his own kiddo world :P ( c'mon I am practically ancient compared to u ) but there have been so many moments in which you have shown me that you are more mature than I give you credit for :P . Do you remember the Bangalore times? We actually fought like cats and dogs over ice cream or something silly and I will never forget going to a movie in that scary abandoned mall at the other end of the city :D :D Melchi, I just want to thank you for helping me create such awesome memories and I hope that we create much more in the future! I am gonna miss you a lot kiddo! xoxoxo!               "
pgp31060,John Melchi,Melchi,hastaHuaMelchi,,"An essay for you..
Melchi is the youngest member in the group. Melchi is a sweet boy. Melchi sometimes talks a lot. Melchi could be mostly found sleeping in his room. Melchi is a friend you can always rely on. Melchi will always stand by you no matter whether you are right or wrong. Melchi causes confusion because though he being the youngest member he calls others choti. Melchi loves food. Melchi loves laddu, but laddu should be without ghee, because ghee gives him cheeks! (and he looks cute with cheeks :D). Melchi is a good boy. Melchi has soo many girlfriends, but he is also a focused follower.       "
pgp31060,John Melchi,WonderfulFriend,,,"As you said in your testimonial, you have been more than a companion for me. We have shared so many wonderful moments in this campus.

Thank you for creating such beautiful memories..                   "

It was fun to be with you. Next time, on any trip we'll take one more guy to give you company, but you'll agree that the trip is memorable. You are a good friend, Melchi. I am sure, you'll do great in life. Wish you all the best.  "
pgp31060,John Melchi,story_teller,dosth,lazy,"It is hard to describe anything about you in words. You are one person at one point of time and then you have the tendency to change and be this completely silent and non-replying person. Although you won't agree, but you are very easily maniputable as I have told you time and again. We had some crazy, wierd ""Happy souls"" discussions which are really memorable. Also what I like about you is the fact that you were finally able to go ahead with our bet ( if you know what I mean ;) ). Had a wonderful time with you in Bangalore during summers. Regarding the bet thing, I believe there is something better in store for you.  So be hopeful, be awesome. Stay blessed and keep in touch :)    "

And this would be my gyaan for you in the life. The two years in the campus remained undoubtedly a hell of a ride, and we made memories. I will remember that we learnt swimming together (not exactly 'cos you learnt how to drown in the middle). But then it was fun, and where else we could act so recklessly. I hope our paths will cross sometime again in future and that I will see a different Melchi who would have achieved all its potential by then.   "
pgp31060,John Melchi,Super-caring,,,"You surprising me by coming to Delhi for my birthday is by far the best birthday gift I have ever received, and possibly, one of the best memories I have at IIM L along with the dinner that never happened due to comedy of errors. You're trusting and trustworthy, and your ability to stick to your values in moral dilemmas shows your character. I'm not saying goodbye to you because you've got a friend for life! :D           "

Keep practicing your Hindi with that unique accent  and be the Casanova :D
It was nice knowing you and spending time with you. Although we had a lot of fights and differences in our opinion but then everything makes a memory. It was hell of a journey here with you making so many memories. Chal pics click karwate hain with me disturbing you :D (teri solo pics naa hone dungi main)

Amidst your passion for football, you being athletic, the amount of food on your plate is a clear winner, and sometimes it makes me wonder how can a guy like you eat and drink so much (who's still a beginner) but then again you Punjabi, which explains everything.

pgp31062,Abhishek Khanna,Khanna,,, Khanna urf the gaali master (as I don't have the count about how many slangs you made during the whole placement week ). The thing which I will always remember is you partying after getting high and dancing like anything on all the Daler Mehndi songs (and not to forget Nishank's party :P). Hope to continue this bond and getting more high stories of yours and wish you all the luck in life.

Funfilled and intelligent, bus thoda hasta kam hai tu (photos mein :P) I still remember when I came to your room to show my Election manifesto but then you and Argha were paying FIFA, which I was also enjoying! I would have missed a very good friend for lifetime if I wouldn't have met you. I really mean that. In case you get Mumbai as job location we will have a blast!!! Waise I wish you get Gurgaon. BTW just reminding meri shaadi mein 2 hafte ki chutti leke aana hai. We will be in touch Always! Love You!   "
pgp31062,Abhishek Khanna,FIFA_Buddy,,,"I think we first met when Ayush told me that you also play FIFA and since then it has been one hell of a game. The long FIFA nights, the crazy parties, riding pillion on the bike with you (still scares the shit out of me), listening to classic rock, the group mein magai... I wish I could re-live those moments again a thousand times over. You are one of the most genuine persons I know and I don't know why people might think that you are arrogant but I know that they can't be more wrong about anything. When Neil Young says that he is still looking for a heart of gold, I'm sure he is yet to meet you. Just be the way you are… super fun and let's continue our FIFA battles for a longtime. Because you are never too old to play FIFA.       "
pgp31062,Abhishek Khanna,Khanna,Indian_Idol,Back-end," I adopted this boy Khanna when one of the guys left IIML for FMS way back. Since then, I have cared for him, provided for him, nurtured him, sheltered him, and what not! The results have been nothing unexpected: Khanna is the poster boy when it comes to finance, economics and HR (widely known as the ""HR God of IIML""). He has even got my sleeping traits. One of the famous quotes for Khanna by a famous prof, ""Khanna might be a pain in the arse in the classrooms, but his answers are a treat to read."" Well, that sums it up (about me, of course, aakhir paala posa kisne!). Bas ek khwaish hai tujhse bhai, ki gaana mat gaaya kar. Hostel 14 has the best singer and the worst singer too!! Hostel 14 waalon, if you guys didn't know about that one voice which keeps irritating your ear drums, it's Khanna's voice. He has the ability to drink more than 100 litres of water daily (he goes to the loo every 30 minutes!). He walks like those back-end waale log, even dresses like them sometimes. But koi nai Khanna, you will always be my adopted boy, chaahe log kuch bhi kahein!!!         "

You whistling outside room 316, or parking your skinny self in it or utilizing my white board (I'm so glad I bought one) was initially a happy distraction but it grew to become something I waited for daily, eagerly. You bubbling ball of energy, I have never been hit by a force as hard and trust me, I am forever grateful. And what I feel for you, if this isn't what love is, then I don't know what the word can possibly mean. I have loved you more each moment we've spent together.

pgp31068,Ankur Singh,Chill,Stud,Peace," Ankur, I appreciate your attitude towards life. You were always relaxed in these hectic two years. At the same time, you also performed well both in academics and in placements. This shows how efficiently you devote your efforts. I appreciate your general knowledge and hope that you will continue to read and watch interesting new things and share them with us. You have a very bright future and I really want to achieve new heights in your career. Just do not let some small habits deviate you from that path.  Wish you all the best and stay in touch.  "
pgp31068,Ankur Singh,Peace,,,"Ankur you're one person I never thought I could be friends with. Yet 2 years down the line you are one of my closest friend. You are insanely smart and annoying. You make me watch the most random videos on literally anything in the world..*quizzing nerd*. Because of you I've started using *peace*. I shall never forget the crazy killer look you gave me when I accidently slapped you once . You are the epitome of kamina insaan with a very shareef shakal. I don't know how women fall for your good looks and charm not knowing what calamity just struck them. But everything aside, Ankur you've been my support system at hell. From 5am panic calls to 12am knocking on your door, you've managed to bear me strikingly well for the last 2 years. You make me believe in bffs :) The Joker dialogue would be most apt for you..""No no I don't want to kill you! What would I do without you :)          "
pgp31068,Ankur Singh,Underdog,,,"The underdog. Yup, that's what you are. I had no idea about your existence prior to Qcomm selections (No offence). But over the last one year, you are one I have come to admire a lot, be in the random knowledge you have to the lovely questions you framed (I still can't get over the ""chai-paani"" question). You have been an epitome of dedication and the amount of effort you put in for F&B in Nihilanth, bro, hats off. No one could have handled it better. All this in the middle of Finals preparation and then scoring it with EY. Hats off bugger, hats off.    "
pgp31068,Ankur Singh,Baba,,,"Baba! Our love for Mahadev, laddoos, singing together and what not! See you enroute to Medina bro!     "
pgp31068,Ankur Singh,Aalas,Jhukna-Padega?,,"We knew each other from before but bonded more during the experiential learning course. It were some great times and that ""course"" would not have been as much fun without you. You might be lazy but I know you will move the world for the people you care about. It would have been great had we known each other more from before. I think we would have been much closer friends (although not as close as ""someone"" thinks :P).   "
pgp31068,Ankur Singh,Quick-witted,Adorable,Knowledgeable,"If you ask me that 1 best thing IIML has given me,it would be impossible to answer because it has given me 3.My best friends.My Family.Ankur is one of them,the youngest of them all in fact.There are 3 things that describe him aptly. First, his ability. His ability to put peace, which is on a whole different level. Secondly, his punctuality. He is so punctual that he reaches exam/quiz hall before invigilator at times. He is so punctual that he even writes his DOB as 6 months prior to his actual date of birthday. Basically he is a PCom's fantasy. Lastly his commitment. His commitment of staying away from mess. It requires emotional blackmail from 3 of us to make him eat in mess (No kidding!!). On a serious note, His aptitude, acumen and awareness are truly commendable. The level of maturity and sense of manner he expresses surpasses those of similar age group. And his sense of humor is quite appreciable. I cannot forget the numerous stomach pain he has instigated through his quick wit comments (Most of which were directed at Visakha :P). We have shared laughter and cries since day one at this place. He is among those who made my 2 years of MBA life very special. He is not just friend to me; he is a brother. Hugs and poochies bro!!   "

pgp31068,Ankur Singh,PartnerInCrime,,,"You were my favorite person in the campus, most beloved and will always remain so forever. You made this place look like home where I always had you as a baby to take care of, to be sure he does not get sick, or fall off while running, or does not stay hungry. You are so close to my heart that I know how you like your maggi and how much sugar you take in your tea. Because of your obsession to punctuality I started doing things a little bit on time, for you creeped me out when anything got delayed. I loved how someone can be so innocent and mature at the same time, sharpest lad but still grounded. I will remember how bad you were at smiling at cameras and how lazy you could possibly get that you just could not move.  You were my partner in crime, the one who shared good music and great movies, with whom I laughed watching every kind of animal's videos. It was a bliss to have you around me enjoying, laughing, eating like a kid. I will miss every bit of it! I wish you all the happiness of this world and lots of love!       "
pgp31069,Anuja Rege,Talented,,,"Anuja has become a dear friend over the course of the 2 years at IIML.I have always been in awe of her knowledge in finance(She's a CA after all),presentation skills,humility and helping nature.I passed in FM in 3rd term only because of her constant help and moral support:) She would never say no to me to take part in all random online quizzes and any competition that I felt like taking part in. I will always cherish the insightful conversations we would have for hours together sometimes!!All the best for everything in life Anuja:)                     "
pgp31069,Anuja Rege,Go-getter,,," After mutually friendzoning each other, we became each other's best secret keeper. The level of comfort we shared could envy a proper couple :P Anuja is master of all the skills she needs to survive and dominate in the corporate jungle. All the best!"
pgp31069,Anuja Rege,Smart,Sweet,,"You have been my neighbor since 1st day then became my classmate. We had done a lot of parties together and shared so many secrets.

pgp31069,Anuja Rege,Gritty,,," Your grit while facing difficult situation will always be admired. PJs that you crack during parties and the way you expect everybody to laugh will always be remembered. Let's catch up in ""SOBO"" (South Bombay) after that and start eating more than 2 pizza slices from next time.          "
pgp31069,Anuja Rege,Soulmate,Muffin,StudMuffin,"I literally have no idea what I'd have done without this one! She's hopelessly believing, unwittingly helpful and crazily sassy: basically hard-wired to be a consultant :P There are moments when she'll make you want to kill her (Hey there, Muffin!); there are moments when you'll respect her (work hours o.O) and there are moments when she'll make you weak in the knees (my b'day dinner!). The singularly craziest package I've met in life without whom I can't even imagine what Hell would've been. It's true what they say about B-schools: you meet your soulmate and in Anuja, I surely met mine :)                          "
pgp31069,Anuja Rege,strong,intelligent,accomplished,"I still remember the L'Oreal ppt as if it happened yesterday. I had won a goodie bag and i gave the most valuable item in it to the pretty girl sitting next to me. Little did i know that i would be getting something a lot more valuable in return. She is the best person in campus to embark on long campus rounds, to watch a movie with or simply wine and dine along. Ten years down the line she will be a wily and cunning Partner/VP but this testimonial will never let her forget that she was strategically out-negotiated in business (yes i made a killer deal) by a odia lad. Jokes aside, if our adversities mold us into a stronger person then she is definitely cast out of wurtzite boron nitride(google it). A wonderful intern, top grades, sought after committee, lit events... you name it and she has done it. And she does it without taking any help. I hate her for that. I couldn't thank L'Oreal enough for bringing in such a person into my life. Keep smiling and don't listen to what anyone tells!!(except me)    "

pgp31070,Anupriyanka .,UnexpectedFriend,,,"We met before the official beginning of the session and never thought we could be friends. But still one of our most memorable memories is 'common', I guess so. And at the end of these two years, here we are, we have become far closer friends than anyone of us has ever thought. Our MP CG connection and being of same age among these kids made it so easy to have a conversation. This was the first time I was staying in hostel and being with you all (wingies) made this experience worth. Stay in touch.  "
pgp31070,Anupriyanka .,worldy-wise,,,I could discuss any problem with Anu and she would provide me the most practical and doable solution to all my problems.Her solutions have saved me from trouble and sorted my life out on numerous occasions!!Anu would always be concerned about how the whole world is exploiting me and that I need to become more street-smart:D Thanks so much for being a part of my life!!May God bless you with happiness and success in abundance:)

pgp31070,Anupriyanka .,Loud_Mouth,Advisor,," Every time we meet we talk non stop for hours. The one person on campus who can meet my volume. You are my only confidante,the one person I turn to in a moment of doubt. I am pretty sure I have memorized almost everything that has happened in your life. I don't think there is any topic left for us to discuss now. But even then I am sure if we run into each other again at 4am while going to the washroom we will talk for hours in the corridor in our loud voices and wake everybody up. Talking till 10 am in the morning and then going to sleep became a routine for us. I have been your only non veg companion (partially)! I will miss having a gossip partner like you when I leave! Lotssss of Luv!!       "
pgp31071,Arjun MD,BigB,,,"The coolest guy on campus, the party animal, the first person to throw party on the night everyone reached IIML for the first time, heart throbe of hundreds of girls, sexy dude, what to say more, you taught people how to party and still be sober..how to flirt and still be innocent..! The IIML would have been lot different if you hadn't blessed place with your presence..! Well that's that (lolz)..speaking of us, I don't think a few words can explain what we have.. I thought home was a place, but you made me realize home is a feeling.. You pampered me and cared for me..you scolded me and loved me..you taught me good and bad..you empowered me in ways you won't know..you truly made me feel home my brother... It was truly an honor to say to the world that you are family!             "
pgp31071,Arjun MD,Gentleman,,,Hey there. It has been a bumpy ride for our friendship but we sailed through the tough times. You are a very nice person. Generous. Kind. A man of principles.

pgp31071,Arjun MD,MD,,,"Hey MD. First of all, honest to God, you are my favorite person in the committee. Subway and that ganna juice was the only quality time we spent together. Its great that Meghna came into your life, but I really hate the fact that we didn't get to spend any time after her. And it sucks that you are not coming for the gradtrip with us. You are awesome MD. Please stay in touch:) If I get deserted somewhere, you are the person I would like to be with man. You are genuinely a good person. And I will always remember when you stepped on my laptop and broke my screen. Also, the time during selections, when I was really low and you talked to me and told me what I was doing was right. Thanks for everything man   "

He has a wicked sense of humour - you will always have fun around him. He really cares about others, knows when they are feeling troubled and tries to help them out. Working together with him was a great experience. He became a truly close friend (too close to be called his first girlfriend by his actual gf :P).   "
pgp31071,Arjun MD,Most,,," MD! We didn't have a great start, but it's hard to not be your friend - with your smashing good looks recently accentuated by the specs, who can ever resist you!

No one comes close! "

pgp31074,Ashwin Manoj,Player,,,"Somehow I am only reminded of your girls when I think of you. Let's accept the fact that you were a silent player (one of the best). Checking on your attributes, well there is the smirk smile at every damn thing, your description of people (again smirky), your don't care attitude (although you care), and well 'the attribute of Chandler' (I am sure you know what I mean :P). I love the way you describe me as your younger brother to others. We have had our share of memories, even before reaching IIML (remember our first call), our fights, our gossips, our travels, our fun times...well the list is never ending... You were and will be always the immature friend I had (who I expect never to grow), one of few I will really really miss...            "

I have been a pain for you so many times, I'm sorry for those days. I wish I could teach you Hindi, which you should learn anyway. Our long campus walks, frequent trips, so many fights, the way you play snake-and-ladder and the Whatsapp conversations, all will be dearly missed. From wild animals encounter to the unbelievable Agra trip experience, I now have many stupid and funny stories with you. I am happy that stex program happened, coz we became close friends then. Indeed you are special to me.  Don't you dare forget me, I'll come and kick you. Love you so so so much, sexy boy!        "

But after getting close to you really liked ur personality...Ur calm attitude...The way you stick to your values and ethics come what may is really admirable and inspirational...The memories made with you are memorable...Thank you very much for everything.. 
pgp31075,ASHWINI GUPTA,Talented,Practical,Respectful," Ashwini, you are one of the few friends from our section for whom I have great respect. I was really lucky to get a friend like you. I really enjoyed those times when you shared your HPCL experiences with me. Your hard work and dedication are the attributes which would result in series of achievements in near future for you. You just have to continue to follow your path. You are very good in communication with people from different rank (whether a superior or subordinate). All of this will definitely help you in your career. I wish you good luck and hope that you will stay in touch with me always.  "

You are one of the most funny guys that I have met on campus. We bonded so soon and it was just so much fun to spend time with you. Fighting with you, calling you stupid names, hitting you with my flappy hands :P :P. Your friendship helped me become a kid again, I could crack the most stupidest potty jokes with you and still grin like a fool :P. Yes, you did make me suffer through weird series and movie nights ( Poor Shaurya was almost at the verge of tears once or twice :P :P ) but nevertheless, those are going to be some of the sweetest memories that I will remember about you. I was floored, the first time I heard you sing and play the guitar (yes yes, I admit you are talented). I admire the way you live life with so much of happiness and fun, you are like a sweet little bundle of positivity :) . Okay, see I am capable of saying good things too ( mind you, grudgingly :P ).

pgp31077,Avhijeet Kapoor,Gentleman,,," Avhijeet mostly remains quiet and so it is difficult to gauge how smart and sharp he is. More than that, he is a really nice person, very humble, down to earth and makes everyone feel really comfortable in his presence. Wish you all the best in life!"
pgp31077,Avhijeet Kapoor,Workaholic,Humorous,Night_Crawler,"Avhijeet 'Day Z' Kapoor is manifestation of Lord Batman on earth. . Best mind on campus (by a distance), witty-Sense of humour, Kung Fu expert, Cool (Singer, Guitarist, painter you name it), Geeky, night-crawler and still no ounce of ego (kaise ??.)

Lucky to have you as neighbour in first year.  Dude, you were always an inspiring figure when MBAs are known to play a zero-sum game and undercut others. Remember the tonnes of Cheese Garlic Bread and Nachos we gorged at Amul.   
I was hammered in possibly every way during our Summer Intern process and your face told me how much you care for me. That Nepal trip, I was driving at 104 KMPH and this guy told me to go faster, WTF. I felt in love with music possibly because of you.
I have just one complaint- I should have thrown your Passport. We could have so much more (I should pay half of IIML fee :P). If someone ask me to define MBA in four words, it will be you, Amishi and Shubham. Just remember one thing, it is just the beginning and not the end. Cheers.

When I started knowing you better, that image turned upside down to a dance-freak who'll make everyone dance in a party and also dance around till morning. I would always remember his humorous questions and their silly answers, that late night relationship gyaan, random daru parties.
Despite this kiddish image of yours and despite being youngest in the group, you are one of the most caring and mature person that I've known.

How during those times, other people sitting with us used to consider us 'knuckle heads' when we used to spill crazy shit. It was fun to be around you. We have created so many amazing memories like Hotel Gomti, amazing bike trips of campus and what not. I am sure you will not be able to forget 'Atankwadi' but just in case keep in touch. You have been a crazy friend and at the same time a confident who knew what was going around in my life. Thanks for being that support. "

pgp31079,Prathamesh Bobade,The_Dude,,, Always calm and composed. I've learned a lot from you. We are brothers on the field and off it. We fight a lot but thats only because we are like brothers. The only thing I can suggest to you is that competition is good but too comparison can lead to unhappiness bhai. Stay content with what you have            
pgp31079,Prathamesh Bobade,Handsome,Friendly,,"Hear hear! There's P-Bob in the house! Prathamesh, you're a very nice, honest and friendly guy! You have integrity and you're bashlessly outspoken.

pgp31081,Chaitanya K,Mashup_of_wisdom_&_Intelligence,,, All knowing guru whom we couldn't find anywhere except occasionally in some weird courses                                
pgp31081,Chaitanya K,Quizmaster,,,A brilliant guy that I wish could have known better. My hair have always fallen short of the Afro standards set by you! All the best in life!

Friendly and eager to learn, you stay till the last minute, be it any project. Your contribution and patience to such projects is immensely valued. The hustle and bustle of the campus life could not affect you even in the least and you have managed to stay out of the filths. Best wishes for the future. :) "
pgp31081,Chaitanya K,gyani,,,"It's always a pleasure interacting with Chaitanya.We always have so much to talk about be it sports,academics(very rarely:P),people here or our favourite topic...Bangalore:DI can even crib and cry about trivial issues and he'll listen patiently and even try to cheer me up because he's so nice:)I admire you for 2 things 1 you're an awesome quizzer 2.You had the guts to follow your heart and not sit for placements to focus on your start-up!!I would personally never want our conversations to stop because I become wiser thanks to the free gyaan you given me everytime:)Here's wishing you good luck in whatever you do:)    "

pgp31081,Chaitanya K,Sophisticated,,," Hey Chaitanya, You are really smart and have really nice insights about practically everything under the sun. I loved the discussion sessions we had and would love to talk to to you during my quarter life crisis, mid life crisis,  or any sort of crisis :)"
pgp31081,Chaitanya K,ChaitanyaKumar,,," It is fun having discussions with you. I like you confidence and your take on most of the things, though Ihave doubts about your movie choice :P I wonder how can you be so sincere in every class! Maybe that is the reason of being you so brainy and intellectual. I admire your general knowledge. Wish you all the best for your career!  "
pgp31081,Chaitanya K,Axel,CK,,"The startup guy!! The genuine nice guy from Bangalore, just like his cricketing idol. Outstanding quizzer & a walking repository of startups.....I have learnt so much from the discussions I have had with you. You've been incredible for bouncing ideas off on a wide array of topics, ranging from academics & placements to startups and business strategy. He is definitely one to watch out for in the future. I hope that he goes on to become the most successful entrepreneur from IIML.      "
pgp31081,Chaitanya K,,,,
pgp31081,Chaitanya K,Nigga,,,The one with the entrepreneurial mind always challenging notions and trying to think of newer less cliched ways of doing stuff. We probably had the most differences in Alcom and I'd definitely cherish all our discussions. Skipping sessions though relatively recent and short have also been fun mate. Wish you all the best in your endeavours  dude! 
pgp31081,Chaitanya K,AfroMan,Quizzer,Awesome,"Ceekay. Ceeker. Ceekesium. The nicest, kindest, politest guy on campus! He's the guy I turned to when I'd want a refreshing conversation & not once was I let down. From debating about profs, courses & batchies to I guess anything & everything under the sun, Ceeku never disappoints. Never seen a bigger bollywood fan and vehement defender of the weaklings! Have no doubts you'll machao in life! Wish you good luck! Much love.. mwah!                           "
pgp31081,Chaitanya K,Bro,Quizzer,Crazy-haired,"It's hard to say how we met and bonded but somehow you became one of my closest friends on campus. I really admire your knowledge of everything under the sun and a very rational and logical way of looking at things. I knew I could always rely on you, look up to you for support and you were always there to help me out. You gave me one of the most important learning that I will be taking from IIM L (read CA). It's great that you are doing something of your own straight from campus and I will look up to you in the future as well."
pgp31081,Chaitanya K,Exceptional,Simple,Humble,"The Quizzing god of IIM Lucknow. I didn't want to mention Quizzing as a word in the boxes since I don't think it was quizzing that defined you as a person, rather you defined it by your demeanor. You are an amazing person to be around, especially for the humility with which you carry yourself around. I wish you all the best in all future endeavors. So long Mr. Afro-Jack! :D                                              "
pgp31081,Chaitanya K,Always,,,I didn't know making a friend could be so easy! :)        
pgp31081,Chaitanya K,Conversationalist,,,"One look at Chaitanya and you might take him to be the nerdy, Geek from those Silicon Valley movies or, you might assume that he is next Albert Einstein. All thanks to his curly hairstyle, in reality, he is neither. If you ask people, what talent makes Chaitanya different from others, you will get a unanimous answer- Quizzing.
 Chaitanya is an ace quizzer, no doubt. But, there is something that goes way beyond Quizzing- It is the art of listening. In a professional course like MBA, where everybody is blowing his own trumpet, Chaitanya cares to modestly listen to other people's viewpoints .Given for his knowledge on a whole gamut of topics, you will never be disappointed. Even if he doesn't has much to offer, his listening skills will give you the chance to share something worthwhile.
In his typical pose, he will tilt his head to his right and raise his eyebrows in form of a bow to focus on what you have to say. As you share whatever you have to share, he will keenly listen and then give an appropriate response, which will be more poised and substantiated with logic. Being the only brave person on the campus, who never sought any kind of placements, let's wish him best of luck for his future career.

pgp31083,Chitra Kashyap,Modest,,," I really want to know how Chitra manages to sleep so much and then do so well in exams:)Inspite of being the topper among all girls in our batch,she is so modest and low-key.She does not even do DCP in class which is a trait of all toppers otherwise:P When you talk to Chitra,she will tell you about all the goof-ups and her shortcomings never once boasting about her phenomenal achievements..She has a heart of gold!!A very nice and humble person,I'm glad to have been in the same section and hostel wing with her for 2 year:)May you achieve greater successes in life!! "
pgp31083,Chitra Kashyap,Humble,SleepyHead,GoodFriend,"Chitra, you are gem that IIM Lucknow has been able to identify.You being smart and diligent, would top most of the exams but that is not the reason why you are a gem of a person.Your humility, loyalty, mature nature , your funny,entertaining, crazy talks are what that make you one hell of a person.Personally, you have always helped me out when you could and you are one fo the few persons who have warned me about things sand guided me in the right directions numerous times. I would not insult our friendship by thanking you here, but I hope that we would cherish and sustain this bond even in the future. I wish you a very best in life and I hope you would remember me whenever you would require a friend in life.      "
pgp31083,Chitra Kashyap,Brainiac,,,"I am a fan of your intelligence - me and Avinav used to discuss about your brain and concluded that it is definitely not wired like the normal us. Plus, you have a great sense of humour - everyone who meets you ends up wondering ""kya ladki hai :P "". I am sure you are going to reach greater heights in whichever field you pursue (job, academics) and I wish you a great life ahead.           "
pgp31083,Chitra Kashyap,Doodler,Brilliant,Mysterious,"Had Vidhu not told me about you, I wonder if I ever would have gotten to know you otherwise. And I am glad she did. For knowing someone so brilliant and so much at peace with their own world is indeed a very rare sight. I am glad to have been a witness to that. You are true in your assertion that it is easier to talk with you online than offline. Funny it is though :P And your doodles are always amazing. They are so good to watch, so keep them coming more. Hope the corporate world helps you find a place where your brilliance is treasured and which helps you make it big, in your own terms. All the best for everything that life will throw at you here onwards. Till we meet again, on the other side of IIM L             "
pgp31083 ,Chitra Kashyap,Bindas,,,"One of the most kind hearted girl who can miss the panipuri delight (She really loves it) to buy chocolate for a poor kid crying by the road. Completely lost in her own world, but always available to hear your stories and try the new lipstick you buy with you.
Two months of roommates and we jelled up so nicely. Internship was fun because you were with me. Loved each and every moment spent with you. Stay blessed!

pgp31084,Disha Bansal,Elegant,,,"Underneath the veil of her composure is the daring Disha who will dazzle her companion with her actions. A true representation of how deceptive looks can be, she is that doting friend who can never be forgotten. With many lessons in her pocket, flick a page out, for actions should matter more than the loud words spoken. Watching and learning from my timid friend - a mighty teacher of dexterity in action.All the best Disha.  "
pgp31084,Disha Bansal,Sweetness,,, Newest addition to my friend list. Never expected that we would become such good friends in such a short span of time. Waiting for more meals together. Hope to know you more. Stay in touch.   
pgp31084,Disha Bansal,DB-squared,,,"Pretty smile and an even prettier laugh, that's you! And you're far more beautiful as a person than you seem in your photographs (which, by the way, are stunning). Girls' night outs wouldn't have been as much fun as they have been because of you (soup stories etc.). Also, thank you for being the audience to all my lame jokes. On a serious note, your dedication towards everything you do, deserves everyone's respect. (I hope you're not zoned out while you read this. :P)        "
pgp31084,Disha Bansal,Best,,," The first day on campus, as you entered into 504 and I heard your voice, I was elated. I was relieved to have someone I knew on campus. A friends' friend looked just fine. I ran towards the door to talk to you but you banged it just in time and as I opened I saw you filled with the same emotions. In that moment I knew I found a companion but who knew we would soon become good friends.
The countless steps we walked together, not just during campus walks, but also during our multiple city trips were never tiring. The pizza parties, the dinners, the movies, shopping, and sleepovers all brought us together. I'll miss our times a lot.          "
pgp31084,Disha Bansal,Composed,,,"Hi DB square, one should definitely appreciate you for your sweetness and soft-spoken nature. It was a learning experience working with you in some of the crucial projects in second year, especially from your $5000 profit stint in IF.

pgp31084,Disha Bansal,Helpful,Sweet,,One good thing that happened due to house searching fiasco in Mumbai is that I found a friend like you. You are one person who is always ready to help anyone who is in need be it during placements or when you stayed in the hospital with me. I will miss the long conversations we had sharing almost everything and I will keep bothering you in Mumbai.:)

pgp31086,ekta shetty,Sweetheart,Chatterbox,Adorable," Ekta, the sweetest of people you can find on campus. Amiable and adorable, she'd be so sweet to the strangest of people and make them melt with her sweetness. A nonstop chatterbox, even a throat infection couldn't contain her talking for long, but it's a total delight to see her talk. It's not just babbling, she speaks wise and she speaks bold, I'm a total fan of her spontaneous wits. I don't even remember how we became friends but I'm so glad we did. She is a sweetheart, countless number of lives you brightened with the last minute urgent help requests that she never denied even once, words of kindness and appreciation every now & then that would completely brighten a dim day. Thanks for being you!                      "
pgp31086,ekta shetty,kind,helping,rondu,"You are one of the very few people who are genuinely helping and caring. The thing that I like specially about you is your Jab we met wala ""I am happy with myself"" attitude and frankly this helped a lot to inspire myself. Although got to know you majorly in 2nd year, still I can say that we became good friends probably because of your good nature. But.. but.. you are and will truly remain a rondu for marks. Seriously! even in 6th sem !! . The only thing that brings tension on your face apart from your so chill attitude towards life is this :P . I feel happy that I was also able to help you once regarding that ""dont reply"" advice :P :P but you shouldn't have actually listened to it :P. Would always remeber that party hogi ya ni discussion. Seriously awesome attitude and always be the way you are. Have a wonderful life ahead and keep in touch :)    "
pgp31086,ekta shetty,Pareshaan,,,If I am to define her it wouldn't be an exaggeration to call her the face of Qcomm. The sheer amount of efforts that she had put for the event approvals among a plethora of other works was truly commendable. Thanks for working so much and keeping a watchout on behalf of the whole club:)  
pgp31086,ekta shetty,Sweetest,,,"It's been amazing knowing you. You've been such a nice friend! Whether it be the smallest of things such as collecting parcels from Gate 2 for people to larger things such as hearing me out when I really needed someone to, you have always been a ""People's person"". I still remember the amazing birthday wishes you sent me this year - they really made my day :) You are someone I can pour my heart out to. We've had such great memories from Section B together, and I have enjoyed working with you in group projects. I even remember you letting me spend your first Rs. 2,000 note :P These two years at hel(L) have definitely been happier with you around. Stay in touch!              "

pgp31086,ekta shetty,Dedication,Strong,Sweet,"Pretty sure one of the sweetest persons I have met. But have to agree, your sweetness is directly proportionate to your resolve. One decided, you WILL stand your ground, no matter what (noticed even in FIRE :P ) But your dedication is some other level, running around for permission, facing Prem ji, and EverReady to call up and meet profs whenever necessary, an attitude that will take you a long way. Stay the same and never change.    "

I will remember the innumerable times when you have come to my rescue at a time when I couldnt help myself. At some point you knew more about me than myself.You know how important are you to me. You are the most logical girl I have ever met and I will stand by that word. You will be the one that comes to my mind anytime in the future when I face a dilemma. Sorry if I had hurt you.

I don't know if you have trusted me but I had 200% trust in you. Your confidence is what I envy the most. Tried to steal a bit but failed.One suggestion...Forget and forgive quickly man.            
pgp31090,Srinivas kapaganti,Breakdancer,Junior_Acad_Secy,Chindi,"Kappa!!! I remember the 1st time Harpreet showed you to me like a biological specimen in CV mela :P :P I did not know then that I would be such great friends with you but luckily we were able to spend some really great moments together. Shaurya always told me that u were one of the nicest guyz that he knows & it turns out that he was accurate ( for the first time in his life :P).U were always ready to help or give great advice or even give a new perspective on things. Btw, I am a huge fan of your nagin dance ( though from a distance for safety purposes :P ). U are also one of the most humble guyz that I have met in campus. You have absolutely no freakin idea what an awesome human being you are and that people are really lucky to know you as a friend ( though the jokes can be a little tiring sometimes :P ). I just want to tell you that there are going to be some good, great and really bad times and you are going to ace all of them by believing in yourself. Anyways, you know na that when the going gets tough, you can always count on me!. I will be there to listen to you cry about life anytime :P I am going to miss you a lot Kappa and dont U dare forget me!(I want my African safari, free of cost :P).Stay strong & happy! "
pgp31090,Srinivas kapaganti,Kappa,Helping,,A brilliant person who sees the world differently than others. One of the most well rounded persons I know. Well deserving of the eight figure 'offers' he is getting! Will remember our gaming sessions in Eiffel queue and our chilling out at Monmatre slopes.    
pgp31090,Srinivas kapaganti,kappa,,," Dude! you have a golden heart. You have so many traits which I always aspired to have in my life.

pgp31090,Srinivas kapaganti,Diligent,,," If one wants to learn where hard work can get a person, look at Srinivas. His sincerity helped me (and Aayush, Kunj) freeride in a lot of group projects :P His enthusiasm, his ambitions and his focus to achieve his goal invoke deep respect. Would remember his dance moves and his treatment of Aayush on his birthday ;)"
pgp31090,Srinivas kapaganti,Andhra_Board,Chicken_Biryani,Kapa_wala_dance,"Dude, we have some platonic connection. Same B-Tech college, same section, Same branch, MBA main same hi college se :P.

pgp31092,Kriti Singh,Kristitherockstar,,,"Over the past 2 years we have done a lot of crazy stuff together. The trip to Agra where we planned to see Taj Mahal and ended up in Taj Vivanta for buffet would surely rank among the craziest things I have done on campus. You are one person I could count on to hangout and not get bored with all your jokes and stories. Nobody knows how you manage your attendance, because every term you would just bunk a week and go to Bangalore, Delhi or some other place, you should in fact teach this trick to juniors so that they can also enjoy their stay in Lucknow to the fullest. You are one of the most focused and sincere people I know and you should never change that side of yours but I would be grateful if you cut down on that murder stare of yours. You will always be a ""special friend"".      "

Will miss Palladium trips with you.Thank you for giving me so many good memories in just two months. You are an amazing friend who is ever laughing and makes people laugh too.

The countless hours spent in Panel Room 2, discussing single topic for hours, creating a consensus at 4 AM when most of the college is fast asleep and running summers and finals process were some of the most cherished memories I had on campus with you. Last 2 years were a roller coaster of emotions which taught me how people from completely different backgrounds like us can come together and perform a task to near perfection if they believe and stand with each other as mentioned in the Three Musketeers film ""All for one and one for all"".

pgp31094,Kunj Shah,hemu,,," If I had to define my journey at IIM Lucknow, you will definitely feature in the first few lines. This space is not even 0.01% of what I have to write. There are very few people in front of whom I can be myself and I proudly say that you are one of those persons. I don't know how I would have survived the two tough years if you had not been there. We were the partner in crime in each and everything :P People have used our names interchangeably so many times. I think no one has used the college's infra as much as we did. You are my alter ego (Your vocab is weak, go google it). Thanks for everything :) And mera thoda gussa banta hai ,she took you away from me :P             "

Your energy is contagious and that is why people love to be around you. I am sure you will reach great heights especially because of your attitude of not giving a shit about what people think of you. If god asks me whom I want to be in place of me,I would choose to be you without a second thought. Thanks for letting this gissu looking wierdo who botches up a lot to be your friend...:)Stay in touch... come what may bro         "

pgp31095,Latesh Gyanchandani,Rotulu,Laccho,Dramebaaz,"One of the best, generous and trustworthy people I've met on the campus. Our friendship started with 1/2 peking soup, sipping cutting special chai and discussing some random topics on the nukkad, after that sharing those sizzling matar kam golgappe (don't u dare to disrespect suji wale golgappe), and exploring Lucknow without using google maps. There were times when we beat Shobhu on Lucknow quiz like a pro, talked only Trading and Trash, watched CarryMinnati back to back, Neverending opposing ur endless gyaan and if lucky ending it by goin out for badminton or chai :P On formal note, I would like to thank you for tolerating my idiosyncrasy and crazy habits, for ur constant support and for knowing exactly when to tell me what I want to hear, when I want to hear it the most.

I can never forget how much she cried and supported me when vodafone revoked my offer during our summers..All the best ladki for ur future endeavors!!!       
pgp31098,PRADNYA SONAR,Diligent,CR,Pyajama,"Pradnya is the star that keeps the 5 stars together. Had she not been there the few outings we all had would have been none. She is one of the most sorted people I know and her room is a reflection of her personality. It is well organised, cozy and complete. Her determination is admirable and she can achieve whatever she puts her mind to. 
She has the most extensive collection of pyajamas on this campus which I dream of setting fire to. Love you loads!                "

pgp31098,PRADNYA SONAR,Task-Master,Go-getter,Detail-oriented," We were the only two in our batch to be a part of two committees. To be able to do justice to them, I had to give the case competitions a miss. But you managed them too along with evening school and your section. From the end of 1st year I really saw a transformation in you which made me really proud of you. Your dedication to Bhavishya tasks jumped multi fold and has been so ever since. I don't think I ever said this earlier, but the time when I required support and I was low, we all went for the Bhavishya walk. That really did lift my spirits up. I am really thankful to you for that! I wish you all the best in life, and knowing you, I am sure you will prosper!   "
pgp31098,PRADNYA SONAR,Hostel,Blue-Lays,Shopaholic,"Pradnya!

The amount of data (u kno wht i mean :P) and lifelong research (pun intended) this backs his hypothesis is just flawless. He is one of my first few friends I made on the campus, always helping, a constant source of laughter. He never turns down anything be it playing badminton late at night before early morning class or goin out for dinner a night before an exam. The best were the countless battles between the Geek and the System Guy (the only place where I get to beat u, wait, badminton is also there:P) I would like to thank for walking with me when I needed support, walking ahead me when I needed guidance and walking behind me when I needed someone to watch my back.

You forced me to come to your room and made me watch all episodes of Permanent Roommates in the first week. I don't know who is going to show me all the quirky youtube videos and 90s songs now (remember Nigodi!!) now. And I don't think I will ever be able to watch ""Tip Tip Barsa Paani"" again without missing you. Although we missed a lot of chances of having fun (which is totally on you!!) we had a great time and I hope we continue to do so. Luv you!!       "

You were like a sweet little sister, trying hard to be all mature. You were the one because of whom our little parivar was rich with information and all chatpati khabrein. I loved the way you told stories, with so much of excitement, laughing on your jokes and enjoying your own narration. Your singing skills are exceptional and is the biggest tool you have to scare away people. When in mood for a party, you always set an environment with your DJ abilities and tempo like that of kids. I will always remember how we shared the hatred for some people :D. I will miss your marwadi bhasha, you Kolkata love and love for super sweet food. You are someone who can get extreme cute and extreme intimidating, a talent very few have. I am sure you will be my most successful friend and I wish the same. Lots of love!         "

There is no way you can play a prank on someone or harrass them randomly. Jokes apart, you have been my girl buddy in CC, my neighbour, my source of gossip and my partner-in-crime. Memories with you are endless. Right from boring placement prep to the most happening of parties, we have done it all. Thank you for never doing bad things to me as you do to others.

You're everywhere - either hosting events, or quizzing, or giving gyaan to juniors, or earning bonuses by writing cracker-stuff. How you manage to do this, I don't think I can understand.

Surprisingly, there are not many memories except for those one off talks, but even then I felt we understood and respected each other.

The common project groups in initial terms - the CFM report preparation at 3.30 am in her room, the marketing projects done together-- with her everything seemed to be a cakewalk! And our mutual love for trains <3. The dance parties in my room with Pathak were just amazing. It was great knowing you Pathak and I know we'd stay in touch forever :).                          "

pgp31123,Aastha Sneha,ASP,FoodGoddess,,"ASP!
Tu great hai yaar. I don't even know from where to begin writing about your greatness, so I'm just going to list down the things that I can recollect. 
1. Signing out of placements
2. Doing Disha work for juniors as well as our batch, despite signing out of placements
3. Inside IIM _/\_
4. 42
5. Giving dare2compete quizzes till the last term
6. Campus finalists in so many events
7. Confirming so many tickets
Last but not the least
8. FOOD GODDESS!
(I'm sure I still missed many things)
Jahapana tussi great ho!
Despite all these things, the one thing that I value the most in you is that you're always ready to help, no matter how busy you are. Also, when you and Saumya get together, I always wish there was some popcorn to enjoy the funny ride that would follow :D
I know you have now chosen to take on a new challenge, I sincerely wish you all the best and hope you achieve all the things you set your mind on.   "
pgp31123,Aastha Sneha,Food,Train,CV," My first interactions with ASP (better known as Food Goddess) started during our summers where she would carry food for practically dozens of people. Her expertise in ordering food from restaurants is unparalleled in the group. ASP is one person you would look up to when you talk about women who know will call a spade a spade. One of the boldest person (across genders) you will ever meet and yet she has one of the kindest hearts when it comes to listening out people. Her association with 'Disha' did narrow down the discussions with most people but she will be a total surprise on anything under sun provided you divert the topic. Her ability to draw down inside information is commendable, so if you can bug her enough, you might get some really interesting news :P. She can be an enigma when it comes to her passion in B-School competitions or Guest Lectures or zillion minor events at college, for her these events are an end in themselves. Fun Fact: If you want to annoy her, say something politically incorrect and see her transform in to 'kalimata'. Survival Tip: Don't get into a verbal dual with her, you will regret it!

Thanks bro for always helping out and for always making us all laugh. Though my left ear still hurts ;-)  but still all love and well wishes to this awesome friend and a great human being. Wishing you all the best for your great future from your Jharkhand friend. Good Bye and Good Luck.             
pgp31126,Abishake Koul,Koul,Maruti,,"Luckily (or unluckily) had to bear each other as neighbours in the same section. Ended up sitting next to each other in most courses in the 2nd year as well.He is one of the reasons that I have been able to endure countless lectures and classes. Thoroughly enjoyed all the banter, gossip sessions and fights over these two years. Here's to many more such sessions in the future. In addition to that, he is very disciplined and motivated, something that I have always admired about him.                  "
pgp31126,Abishake Koul,Funny,Hardwoorking,Hutiya,"Or should I reverse the order. Man, I am still sad that you couldn't go on STEX. I think this is one thing which he wanted, but couldn't do in two years.Otherwise,he learned how to swim, became Frisby captain, almost entered in football team,almost became a placecomer but  entered into MCC anyway, won competitions, learned finance & above all got a PPO from Mondelez.    He can get anything he wants to because he knows how to do it or he will find a way to get it (except in one aspect!!!!! you know what I am talking about :P But I seriously believe its THEIR loss). I think we should've spent some more time together drinking (you make more sense when you are drunk). But, Hell!! we are not dead yet. I am also waiting for the day when you figure out what to do..becoz, I know when you are clear about what to do, you will excel in it.. Will miss our drunk nights..Love.   "
pgp31126,Abishake Koul,Koul,Sir,Koul," Koul, wow, what a guy, he is a rare type you will find. Koul is one of the super smart, savvy, and always forward then the rest in the group. He is a BIG Gossiper. Probably knows all News of the campus. Best part of Koul is that he is not at all diplomatic, he will be and would say whatever he feels and thinks. On your face , he will be Blunt!. Which I like since he doesn't hide and says the truth. I would always go to him for any suggestions and advice, since i know he knows and would put it straight on my face. Koul has come a long way in this journey of MBA. He started with a few bumps, but then he kept on reinventing himself and making a come back. whether its CGP, extra curriculars. He learned that new game Frisbee, just to prove the fact that he is even good at sports. And what to talk about the competitions , he knows that we both have really struggled, but we learned a lot. He has many unfulfilled wishes like me from this IIML time, but I hope we will get our wishes fulfilled once we are out from here. Wish him all the best, Hope he becomes a Top Professional, and i am happy that i can say - I can call Koul anytime.             "

pgp31126,Abishake Koul,Everlasting,Competitive,Fun,"If anything is happening at IIM L, be sure that you will find him there no matter what is the event. Ultra competitive and wants to do it all but still missed out on one thing. Numerous competitions and Squash sessions at which we both suck could not deter us from trying. But at the end of the day, there would be very few people who are as fun to hang out with and extremely knowledgeable at the same time. I will always remain grateful for numerous occasions where he helped me out
    "
pgp31126,Abishake Koul,Maruti,,,"Koul is a cheerful person and is regarded as Ops God. He was synonymous with Maruti Suzuki and Supply Chain. Because of his mis-deeds in Term-1, he had to give up on his dream of going on Stex. He was as close to Stex program as the Line of Control would be to a country. He stood up and fought for committee members, when the situation demanded. "

Yes , I am following you on instagram as dictated by you and shall like all your post henceforth! Keeping banter aside, you are everwhere during my 2 years stay at campus. It all started in term-I as we had 3 projects together and I still remember our first epic conversation in library and we rocked from that onwards! You took care of me during these years and I am grateful for that. You are a go-getter and accomplished everything you wanted to here except one :P ! A passionate writer, sare-competition-me-participate-krne-wala, a quick learner! You inspire me buddy! I shall end with ""Tumne kaha ki mere dost ho tum, maine kabhi nai kaha Vyast hu mai""!

pgp31126,Abishake Koul,Rotlu,,,"One person with whom I can share all my sorrows, happiness, anger in IIM Lucknow. But bhai itna mera 2 saal ka nephew nahi rota jitna tu rota h..But it was always fun getting into those small fights with you. May be we started finding our fun in that. You are one of the most dedicated  person I have ever met. Working with you was always a great learning. I will always remember the fun we had participating in case study competitions. Thankfully we won some campus rounds in the end...Your next target should be to publish all your poetry and show your talent to the people outside..And I expect my name in the acknowledgement section of the book..Kudos to the wonderful time we had together...

pgp31126,Abishake Koul,Bakchod,Better_call_Koul,,"If you have a lot of free time, Better Call Koul! He will tell you stories about more than half of the college (true or not, that's for you to figure out :P). He is dedicated at times, fun to hang out with and a 'potential' friend for life. Koul definitely surpasses me or anyone for that matter on cribbing. Kitna rota h yar. Tu InsideIIM k posts kam dalta toh hum shayad better dost hote :P. have a great life dude.

"
pgp31127,Achyut Awasthi,Achyyuutt,,," Two years with so much gyan to listen to. I can't begin to think how the first year would have been like with you not on my left. You are one of the smartest persons in the campus I know. Then, the geeky quizzer and stud footballer… Too much talent for a lifetime… I know you will achieve greatness and do something which will be different from the routine grind… All the best :)                 "
pgp31127,Achyut Awasthi,IIC,CC,Strategic,"Projects, Disqus, IIC, there have been so many things that we've been in together, but most importantly you're my partner in food. If there is one person I'll blindly trust to join me over any fooding plans, it's you. And, for me, that's the highest honor I can give you. Tera SRA wala roop kaafi baad mein saamne aaya but I would have loved be a co-analyst. Lol. I really hope to stay in touch with you. But, kaash us ek IIC task mein rok liya hota tune :P    "
pgp31127,Achyut Awasthi,Sensible,,,"A^2!
One of the well-read people on campus with a sound rational mind, but also the vital node of information (read gossip). All in all, you do have a very nice smile!
 "
pgp31127,Achyut Awasthi,Football,Quizzer,Serious,"The only person you are guaranteed to find in the CC other than helpdesk bhaiya is Achyut. He occasionally takes breaks from CC to play football and be the DJ at parties. His hidden talents include dancing but only the lucky few on this campus have witnessed that. 
We really enjoyed dragging him to all our Dastar Khwan trips and parties. I know there is no chance of being in the 5 but I hope we make it to your list of 17-20 people! :P                   "
pgp31127,Achyut Awasthi,Intellectual,Tenacious,Composed,"Achyut is one of the rare people who really knew what he wanted from this campus from Day-1 unlike many of us who often were victims of the herd mindset.I am yet to meet a second person who talks football/economics/finance/policy/music with equal ease.A huge resoirvoir of 'gyaan',I never saw him lose his cool during the last 2 years & wannabe-DJ bro is one of the humblest people in campus.Don't be surprised if you see him in Davos pretty soon !      "
pgp31127,Achyut Awasthi,Sensible,Fun,,"The sensible guy with a lot of emotions, many fail to see beyond the rationality of this person. Loved having heated arguments with you. One can count on him for info on a host of topics, ranging from football to electronics to world affairs, and the gossips around campus.      "
pgp31127,Achyut Awasthi,Quizzer,,,"You need to find me that German watchman with a mango orchard! You've been a treat to debate with, Awasthi! Live long and Prosper!                           "
pgp31127,Achyut Awasthi,Football,Awasthi,,We interacted more in the 2nd year and connected more over our general outlook towards the kind of career we want to have. I really admire the knowledge that you have about everything under the sun and your passion towards things you hold dear like football and quizzing. You take care about others around you. You have taken some bold decisions in life and that is inspirational. You have given me new directions in life and I will be looking up to you in the future as well.   
pgp31127,Achyut Awasthi,Captain,Soft,Handsome,"How you manage to stay so calm is a mystery to me. Maybe one day I will understand some parts of it. Till then, I hope life gives you all the platforms you need to succeed. Talks with you have been always that crisp and that sweet. Hope the future has more of them in store for us. Take care brother. Good luck for everything.                                              "
pgp31127,Achyut Awasthi,All-Rounder,,,"Given his range of skillset, I believe, Achyut, is one of the most underrated people on the campus. For someone whose forte is Analog Electronics (probably the toughest subject for any engineer), IIM Lucknow is one of the most unlikely places you will find him to be. His technical achievements at Texas Instruments run so high that most people would not even fathom his work-ex column. No wonder, his HEPP shortlists were only a handful few. But, he still managed to get a good placement, thanks to other set of skills. He was elected as the football captain at IIM Lucknow. An obvious choice, for his leadership skills, Achyut has been able to manage the captaincy amazingly well. Rigorous training sessions, every day after the class, is not something all of us are capable of. A constant academic performer, Achyut's quizzing skills is also something most of us already know about. Quizzing or not, he is always well informed of almost every latest news you would probably like to know about. Be it acads, sports or quizzing, Achyut never takes anything for granted and is able to put his 100% and that too, with a smile on his face. Looking for more opportunities outside the campus, we wish him all the best with his future aspirations. "
pgp31128,Aditya  Agarwal,Chotu,,, My side partner for one entire year and the first person with whom I met and be friend on campus. You are a person who carries a smile every time on his face and with whom it doesn't feel that you are with someone with not your age. One thing that I will always remember is our late night talks and laughs. Stay the same always and wish you all the luck in life. 
pgp31128,Aditya  Agarwal,AA,,,"AA you are one of the few people on campus who were my family away from home! The countless hours spent in Panel Room 2, discussing single topic for hours, creating a consensus at 4 AM when most of the college is fast asleep and running summers and finals process were some of the most cherished memories I had on campus with you. Last 2 years were a roller coaster of emotions which taught me how people from completely different backgrounds like us can come together and perform a task to near perfection if they believe and stand with each other as mentioned in the Three Musketeers film ""All for one and one for all"". I know our friendship ki picture abhi baaki hai mere dost.. looking forward to more pcom get together with you after HELL :)  "
pgp31128,Aditya  Agarwal,Chotu,,,"Pcom ka ramu kaka!! Fantastic person to sit next to. Asleep during the classes, fun to talk to during the breaks. Incredibly mature and smart....knows how to get the work done. Enjoyed the countless times I have tried to keep you awake during lectures. Definitely, one to watch out for in the future. I am sure he will have a great life ahead of him. Very fortunate to count you as a friend.                 "
pgp31128,Aditya  Agarwal,Karmatt,,,"Our bond started way back in the Mumbai meet, moved on to HR, then bulla and I'm sure that's just the start.

Work hard and play harder!        "
pgp31128,Aditya  Agarwal,Crazy,Sincere,resourceful,"I had a big shock when I got to know that were 26. I could not believe it . U look and act like a kid and this is coming from me. So u can understand. U gave me various names including TT ball, football, basket ball, luchi bla bla bla. U can never stop talking my case but it is always fun spending time with you,in  mumbai as well when you used to pick me up from my home. But you play poker horribly. :P Stay in touch :* Love: Surbhi   "
pgp31128,Aditya  Agarwal,Cheerful,Best,,"One of the most talented person I have met here in heLL. And with what you had to go through after that unfortunate exams and still, to be as cheerful and ever smiling is something that I learnt from you. I know something big lies there for you and soon you will find that. You are the reason I regret not joining PCOM. I know we would have been a great team. Cheers to all the memories.

pgp31129,Ajay Rathore,Retard,,, Who would have thought that someones birthday could have been so dangerous and would have such a long lasting effect. But now I think it was a good thing that it happened coz you are the life of every party. I dont remember the old Rathore anymore and I guess I am quite happy with it. Stay the same always! 
pgp31129,Ajay Rathore,Retard,,," One of the most epic characters I have met here in heLL. The way you go about your life is something that people should learn.

pgp31131,Amit Saini,Fattu,,,Section C -> Bulla! The transition was very quick and wouldn't have been possible without you.

And now ur room (1350) is like my adda for meeting people...I always wonder how come u never need your privacy....I have so many small small moments with you like swimming pool time when you were pushing me to try it on my own... And many others.. I dont know how to sum it up all here. Just that I am gonna miss you... 
Love, 
Surbhi   "
pgp31131,Amit Saini,.,,," Saini is who I would call the ""jaaan"" of our group, and his room everyone's hideout. Saini, you were amongst my first few friends on campus. The induction week, which ended in Go Bananas, was so much fun, given that all of us were together. Remember how we once skipped the formal induction sessions to play cards? And then, all the innumberable room parties, H16 terrace parties, lobby parties, ghost stories, and outings, they wouldn't have been so much fun without you!  I always loved taking selfies, gossiping (which you soooo love to do), and doing deep conversations (which unfortunately became less by the end of 2nd year) with you! Amit, truly speaking you are one of the most genuine persons that I have come across in these two years. Your care for your friends makes you stand out. You are full of life and its always fun to be in your company. I am surely going to miss you after campus. Come to Delhi soon!                "
pgp31131 ,Amit Saini,stud,Bhai,," Saini! My judwa brother as some say :P. My first friend in college. I remember how we instantly gelled right from the Delhi meet along with Paggu. Had the most amazing of first few days together at campus. Those rooftop parties, Go Bananas, Birthday celebrations, outings etc.– all of these memories shall remain with me for life. All the best for the second innings after campus. "
pgp31133,Anant Singh,Sir,,," I think it was destined for me to meet and learn from someone who has experienced life like you have. I have never called you Sir because you are older but always out of respect. I will miss the drinking sessions we had with you sharing your plethora of experiences, the walks to mess and the chit chat in classes. The passion you have for social sector and the dreams  you have are surely gonna make people follow your path in future.  I am very happy that you are going where you are because you are gonna do wonders out there. I hope your triad becomes  a pentagon soon. You are very lucky to have Shweta and I know with the marriage on the cards, you are gonna get busy but do remember us. All the best Sir… :)

That's why we all look forward to him. He has had such a varied life experience so far, that has made me him wise and strong. Me and Sir connect on  a couple of things, one of which is always our starting talking point.Ahaha, I always take back from his experience and his thoughts. Thank you Sir for so many memorable moments we have had. Sir has had a quite tough experience in IIML, I hope he will take the learnings and move forward in life much stronger. He wants to do something in the social sector, and I can see the passion in his eyes and his words. All the very best Sir. May you Succeed!.    "

Your dedication and priorities towards your soon-to-be-achieved & soon-to-be-wife is unparalleled. Your work-ethics and determination is amazing. I wish I had 10% of it.

I know this friendship will last long.     "
pgp31133,Anant Singh,Generous,Enterprising,Tenacious,"People call him sir & that's rightly so.Frank opinions, rigorous hard-work & a golden heart is what distinguishes Anant sir among many.His many initiatives through Bhavishya have created a huge positive impact in the lives of many.Sir not only does not bask in the limelight,he actively moves away from it & hence many people wouldn't be aware of the work done by him in the last 2 years.I wholeheartedly wish you success sir since that will translate into better lives for many.I have been lucky to have known you.

pgp31134,Ankit Baid,Cool,Dependable,Passionate,"If you make a blend of intelligence, sensitivity, passion, compassion, friendliness and forgiveness, then what you get is Ankit Baid. Hit him, scold him, say something sad/bad to him or do anything – the first and most often the only thing you will notice is an ever-smiling face from this gentleman, irrespective of the situation. He knows how to handle a situation with utmost calmness and his aura and demeanor makes everyone around him happy. Having worked with him closely for around 2 years in IIC, I can say he is one of the most dependable man I have come across in life and achieves results with perfection. His maturity at a relatively younger age can even leave experienced individuals looking out to him for suggestions. Keep smiling and rocking, and I wish for you loads of success in life."
pgp31134,Ankit Baid,Baid,,, Baid bhai. We share common love for food. If you are Mumbai we will definitely have many house parties together. I ll make Poha :P .Stay as you are! Stay in touch!     
pgp31134,Ankit Baid,Stud,,," I've been struggling to find one flaw in you bro. Every moment spent with you makes me respect you more. As I always say, and I literally mean it, you're a stud. Your logic always left me amazed. Apart from being super-smart, you're an amazing human being too bro. That small party in your flat was the highlight of my Mumbai stay. Coming to campus, I can't overemphasise the importance of the pre-finals conversation we had. Thank you baid for everything. Keep eating. Stay blessed.     "

pgp31134,Ankit Baid,The foodie,,,"I have known Ankit since our first day in induction where seniors were taking our case. He looked puzzled yet confident. His always smiling face caught attention of our tormentors and he was asked to stand in front of the class and speak. And my first impression was formed that how confident this chap is..!! You don't want to compete with the guy because he is smart, cocky and carries a scathing wit. I am always amused by his memorizing abilities as well as sharp dissection of complex ideas into simple vocabulary. I know that he is going to be one of those star performers that have been told in induction. Its great knowing you Ankit and keep in touch always &#61514; "

pgp31134,Ankit Baid,Food,Commitment,Intelligent,"I guess one of the first friends I made here in Hell, for someone as introverted and shelled up as me, needed someone as forthcoming as you to open up I guess. I remember how almost everyone on campus knew you and first few months, any walk to the mess used to be interrupted atleast 4-5 times because you met someone you knew. Your academic prowess is one of the best I have encountered and yet you are so laid back and relaxed and make time for everything and everyone. From helping out friends to preparing us for placements to IIC work even after resigning to ""Life@Hell"" Hell, I can go on and on about you. You have been one of my best friends here, and I really hope ""James Bong"" stays for life.     "
pgp31134,Ankit Baid,Understanding,,,"Baid thanks for being the friend you have been. We were not together all times, but I knew you would be there if I were in any problem  "
pgp31134,Ankit Baid,Sweet,All,,"I never interacted with you untill last term. But now I know you are one of the few I always want to be in contact with.

Keep in touch and all the best for your future :)                      "
pgp31135,Ankit Aujla,Dude,,,"Dude you are the quintessential Punjabi... The classy guy who thinks and plans about everything.. You dress better than most Bollywood actors and always made us question our shopping and dressing sense... From the chull to do parties to the chull you had of winning a case competition, the desire was always difficult to fathom.... We both were  cruelly left here by fate in Term 5 and couldn't go for STEX but you did make full use of your time here... I know the chull  of never being satisfied which you have will take you places  and I wish you all the best for your future… Just make sure that you don't sped too much time in Chennai otherwise the people out there are surely gonna cast you in Tamil movies…

pgp31135,Ankit Aujla,Prettyboy,,, The way we have teased you in first year was hilarious. You never lost your calm and always smiled. Keep it up spread prettiness all around.     
pgp31135,Ankit Aujla,Dude,Stud,,"Mr. Ankit Kumar aka dude is well known person and famous for lot of things particularly for his lavish lifestyle, partying nature and never say die attitude (in matter of girls). After being a friend of him close to two year, I realized that he is strict follower of Dudeism 
Dudeism is a way of living of life which originated in Thailand and it is a degenerated form of Taoism. Dudeism advocates and encourages the practice of ""going with the flow"", ""being cool headed"", and ""taking it easy"" in the face of life's difficulties, believing that this is the only way to live in harmony with our inner nature and the challenges of interacting with other people. It also aims to assuage feelings of inadequacy that arise in societies which place a heavy emphasis on achievement and personal fortune. Consequently, simple everyday pleasures like partying, bowling, and hanging out with friends are seen as far preferable to the accumulation of wealth and the spending of money as a means to achieve happiness and spiritual fulfilment.
All the best bro for your future and hope you will find solace in tough environment of Chennai and will maintain your Dudeness

The ever non-judgemental, 3 AM friend. Remember the first 'wild' party, and the hunt for a spectacles shop afterwards :P  That, and numerous project groups and pizza parties sealed a permanent bond :) Suchanti, you have never known this, but I have kept you as an example, on how NOT to lose cool come what may.You were one of the select few who defined Section C and first year for me. (although we could never find the time to recreate the epic first party :/). I know for sure that even though we might not talk everyday, the day we do, it would be the same as ever. Truly blessed to have a friend like you. You complete my 'girl gang', bro! :P                                             "

Shayad us dhoop aur garmi mein Sunday lunch ke liye koi mere saath idhar udhar nahi bhatakta ! But, you're the Stud !! I have seen you facing some big big challenges and smile them in the face and come out on top. You are shit shit worried inside but capable of appearing the Aalsi Suchanti on the outside. Whatever it is, it's great. You are a winner for me and a great great friend !! Mumbai mein tere hi ghar pe pada rahunga dekhna :P    "
pgp31136,Ankit Suchanti,Bestbud,,," Suchanti, words will always be less if I start describing what this friendship has been to me. Whenever I needed a helping hand you were always there. Your friendship has been a blessing to me. No matter how much I thank you, it will never be enough. I know there was a rough patch but we overcame it and became even stronger. You have been really good to me. I will always thank god  for sending you here. You have such a pure heart and such a warm smile. Always keep smiling and be in touch.     "

pgp31137,Ankita Dhawan,IIML,,," You are in essence, IIML, for me. We have shared innumerable moments together, if not all, here at the campus and the space is too short to mention them all. I could sense our sync from day 1 but the time just made the best of it. The fact that many thought you belonged to section A says something about the perception. Then you made the cut for Stex and it was then I realized the void u left behind. You give your best to friendship and so very few people end up matching your level of relation-building. You have fallen uncountable times at parties, only to get up and fall again at the next party ! As sun sets on this journey, it keeps us longing for some more time together here. Thanks for making this hell a heavenly place. A life full of happiness and blessings beckons you ahead. Cheers !!   "
pgp31137,Ankita Dhawan,Dhawan,,,The crying queen who I have seen so many times crying that I can't even count. The thing which will always make me remember you is your lost phone and the way you made everyone find the phone countless number of times :P. And haan not to forget you fell down ample number of times after getting high and never getting hurt and making everyone worry :P. Wish you all the luck and hope to have the same bond always. Also you will definitely be coming with atleast a baby on my wedding :P.

pgp31137,Ankita Dhawan,Dhawan,,,I know her as a complete party freak! No one can match her dance moves. I am gonna miss partying with her. As a person she is very friendly & nice (so nice that pcom wanted her in all the PPTs happening on campus :P)

She is a very helpful and a friendly girl. And also she is quite a buddy for a fun party. She doesn't  bore like some of the girls do with their gossiping. I am Happy that she was able to go for Stex, as she really wanted to. So I can say that she has had a great journey in IIM, finishing off with a great placement offer. I wish her all the Best for her Future. Be in touch! "
pgp31137 ,Ankita Dhawan,Bestie,,," Ankita is one of my first friends here. It all started with the same Marketing project group in first term. Ankita is one of the confused ones, but she never is confused about partying. Yes, she is a party person and we've togethar partied a lot! I remember those late night case discussions with her in library. Also, the numerous bike trips in and around campus. She simply loves bike rides. Also, once we went in heavy rainfall for project work and got completely drenched. But yeah, it was funn. We're very close and yes we share our secrets with each other. The endless time spent bakaring would be missed. We only met for a while during stex, but because of those few hours we felt like at home again. It was really really nice meeting her. Hope to stay in touch :).           "

pgp31138,Ankur Saraf,BumBum,,,"From out first meeting during induction to the Ops team to this date, our friendship has grown leaps and bounds. You were like Joey, who doesnt share food. But we shared a lot of lunches and dinners together. I will miss those a lot. Going together to classes, being late together even to the exams, working on projects, a major chunk of second year was spent with you. You are one person who made life at heLL easy for me, specially during the second year. I hope this continues in Hyderabad."

pgp31139,ARCHISMAN SAHOO,confused,,,"Sahoo!
We kicked off well as he is a senior from my alma mater. Soon, became such good friends. He plays almost all sports on campus but doesn't believe in winning. Yeah, that's true.

pgp31139,ARCHISMAN SAHOO,Enthusiastic,,, Sahoo!! Your interest in learning things is commendable. Never loose that. I really had a lot of fun playing laser tag in Hyderabad the other day.

Wish you the best in life :)   "
pgp31140,Arushi Goel,Dolly,,,Dolly! We called you EBG for a reason. You are as close to all of us as each one is to the other but the only problem was that you joined in a little late :P.

pgp31140,Arushi Goel,Sweet,Lovely,," Dolly (you will always be dolly for me, no matter what), I have no words to describe our bonding. It is surprising that two people who never talked in the entire first term became best friends suddenly. For you I changed my room and from then we were always together. Be it in classes or stex. Stex was a beautiful time. I had your overdose in 2nd year but I am sure it's not gonna end soon. ACCENTURE it is! I had so much relief when I got to know m gonna see more of you. You form a major part of my life in this college. Bro but you speak tooo much…hahah

She is very calm and composed. Also, Dolly is nocturnal. She is a wiz at academics and group projects, that's why is always given the hardest part. Dolly, all the time spent with you was amazing! Be it, parties, classes, group projects, or the exchange. Sitting in your room in the first year, and chitchatting, is something that I would always remember. Exchange also had its moments, like once when we were unable to find any seat in the train and had to sit in the restaurant for hours, and when we randomly walked 10+ km in Berlin! Thanks for all the great times. Stay in touch! &#9786;               "
pgp31140,Arushi Goel,A,,,"I would describe arushi as the sweetest, talented and one of d most lovable person on campus. We met during d first day on induction, but who knew we would hit it off so well. I still remember how uncertain wer u abt continuing at lucknow during the start....but im sure a lot of us(including u) are thankful abt u taking d right decision...:D
One of d most fascinating thing about arushi is her ""dnt care attitude""...very few people have the audacity to take a decision of not participating in summers just two weeks before the process.
Arushi all said, life without u on campus wouldnt have been d same...u wer one of my biggest strengths on campus. Thanks for all the love and care. Looking forward to being the best friends forever..."

pgp31140 ,Arushi Goel,Sweetie,,,"I don't exactly remember the time we became friends but I guess, it was somewhere around the time you got your leg fractured (:P). You've been one of the closest friends I've ever had in my life. Had never thought we'd ever develop such a strong bond. I remember the time we used to play TT and badminton for hours, the time we used to exchange chocolates. Those late night campus walks and room chilling scenes. Decorating both of our rooms with various posters and fairy lights (<3). It was all too much funn. Those endless choco mud pies from cherry tree! Those parties at my room where we used to dance insanely, b'day surprise planning for Surbhi. That trip to Dudhwa with amazing bus ride was just awesome. I remember the time when you forcefully took me to fauji (paneer pakoras and coffee!), just because the weather was good and you wanted to go out (:P). The best part was the numerous bike rides to city (as well as within campus) and they would surely be missed. All in all, I'll just say it was really nice meeting and knowing you. Have a great life ahead! "
pgp31141,Ashish Goel,Free-Spirit,Cool-Guy,,"Ashish was my first year neighbour and teammate in numerous campus competitions. Will always remember those philosophical discussions and jamming sessions bro. Ashish is an awesome company, very intellectual yet grounded. Wish we could have hung around more in the last term!     "
pgp31141,Ashish Goel,Darpok,,,"It's been only a year since I've known you and I wish I had known you sooner. I know you hate me for mocking you about you-know-what :p.. You're one of the few guys I've met who love to gossip as much as you do. But jokes aside, you're a lovely lovely person and a wonderful friend who is still scared of his special friend :p  "
pgp31141,Ashish Goel,Tau,,, The kind of effort you put in and the grind you go through is inspiring. Always making best use of the time. I have learnt so much from you over the course of two years. I will also miss the gossip sessions with you and Achyut… You will surely rise your way in the coming years ad I hope you continue doing that… All the best …:)      
pgp31141,Ashish Goel,Mausi,Steroid,,"Gossip king of the campus!! Somehow, always interested in gossiping about anyone on the campus (even profs!!). He is truly the ""mausi"" of the campus. This is probably something that happens to everyone with age. On a serious note, you are a fantastic friend and guide. I have enjoyed multiple discussions, debates and arguments that I had with you. Incredibly smart and confident as a person, it is very re-assuring with you as a team member in several group projects. In addition, I have enjoyed countless movies, food treks and parties with you. Incredibly proud and fortunate to count you as a friend.                "
pgp31141,Ashish Goel,Guru,Finlord,," My first project group on the campus, MM-I was with you, and there were EPIC people on that group (all of us!!) I remember talking to you and feeling like, *wow, if there are this mature and sincere people on campus, I'll definitely learn a lot*,and that I have. Chahe woh MM-I ho ya CBRM ya phir apna Disqus group Ashish bhai you have been a Guru!!  "
pgp31141,Ashish Goel,Smart,Funny,," Ashish, from the look and the first meet might not give the impression that he is actually quite a unique personality. When you start knowing him more, you realise he is a rare gem.Ashish is a very straight forward, smart thinking guy, with a huge potential. He has tried various things on campus and always tried to succeed in most of them. His views and actions are noteworthy. Our first real connect happened on the Yes Bank Case competition. Though sadly we couldn't win the competition, it gave me a good friend whom I can trust. I hope this friendship continues further and further. Be in touch Bro!     "
pgp31141,Ashish Goel,Hardworking,,, I saw a big brother in you. Thanks a lot for all of your support and guidance during internship. Really enjoyed all the time spent together in 1st year. Stay in touch                        
pgp31141,Ashish Goel,Chill,,,"Having him in some of the project groups has been the best thing. He always takes the first step in initiating, reducing much of your burden. A person, always in pursuit of improvement, having his own share of chilling.  Doesn't hold anything against anyone, much sensible, and you wouldn't believe he is older to you when you speak to him. Young and cheerful, you sure will shoot up to great heights! "
pgp31141,Ashish Goel,PanchayatiMausi,Diligent,Modest,"Ashish is the most likely person from IIML to work in news in the future as he believes in keeping himself updated with the happenings in the world and more importantly, happenings on campus. This can be attributed to the popularity of All India Radio when he was a teen considerably long ago.He has never met a financial theory or a piece of gossip he didn't like.
He is a very modest and diligent guy with a flair for finance, dramatics and pulling people's leg. He is the life of all our outings and made working on all our projects fun!            "
pgp31141,Ashish Goel,Brilliant,philosophical,," We don't talk very often but I still remember that moment in Varun's party when you called me your ""sweet little sister"". I will always cherish that moment and I want you to remember this as well. You are one of the most brilliant minds of this college and you are just so amazing and happy go lucky. Stay in touch.
Love,
Surbhi

pgp31141,Ashish Goel,Inspiring,Self-motivated,Go-getter,"A person whom I have always looked upto,Ashish represents the best of IIML.Embodies the few on campus who study for the 'joy of learning' rather than merely pursuing grades.His journey from Meerut to IIML is an inspiration to those who have heard the story.Extremely fun to work with because of the sheer effort he brings to everything he takes up.This testimonial may appear like a fanboy write-up but there's really nothing you can pull Ashish's leg about(though he should be more regular with exercise!)         "
pgp31141,Ashish Goel,Fun,Mature,Crazy,"Doesn't act his age, at all! Youthful and cheerful, he will surprise you with his attitude. His love for learning and bakar is unparalleled. Always there to share his wisdom on important issues, and for sharing latest rumours and gossips around the campus. Stay young at heart!      "
pgp31141,Ashish Goel,Panchayati-mausi,Bauji,,"Ashish is a fun loving person. Rumours are that many of us were still in school when he started his job. Yes, he's that old. He's our 'bauji'. Considering his age, he's still young at heart :P. He's one person with more knowledge than anyone else regarding anything, and can be approached easily by anyone. He can give competition to any of the gossip girls on campus, he's the panchayati mausi. For me, he's my best friend here, rather an elder brother. Also, a guide and the most supportive person here.

A true hanuman bhakta, he regularly goes to mandir with his trio group (Atul and Munna Yadav). After dinner, he can be seen roaming around the campus or sitting somewhere with his cup of tea and endless talks about politics, college and funny incidents about fellow helices. We did only one party together on the eve of the new year but he was legendary on that one. With his craze for fast beat Punjabi songs and the powerhouse like energy, he could be real fun when in the mood of partying. He will achieve many heights with his coolness and sharp mind.

Atul has shown unique qualities in the sea of so many similar looking batchmates of hell. He is actually very intelligent yet lives a very simple life. Never believes in doing things just to impress someone else, only for inner happiness. He loves to eat mangoes, gajar ka halwa or for that matter any other sweet dish in the mess. Often you can see him eating 3-4 bowls full of ice-creams. A true friend at heart, he never refuses anybody for anything and always tries his best to help others. I have many vivid memories of him as we were together on many journeys back to home or coming to hell from Jaipur. He gave me nickname of 'tauji'. :D Be as simple and kind as you are at present.

I have only been amazed how someone can always smile back, be the kindest person, and be ever ready to take up responsibility, bear a fault, and still try the best to contribute. I am glad I can observe you and learn from you. The best thing is you have never been high-headed, despite all the success and accolades, you're still the same Sakti who can not refuse if requested.

I still remember how u used to fear my shout and come to class just within 5 mins of your waking up. All the time spent was just awesome.

You are stronger than you know and I'm glad that no matter how difficult it may have been, you put all crap behind you and moved on. It is almost cute how you still use the archaic ""keval"" while speaking in Hindi :P. I still remember you laughing your ass off at Ghivari and my attempts to kill some demonic mosquitoes in my room. Plus, you are the only one who really appreciated my first year room *happy tears*. My charms seem to have worked on the entire Saxena family :P. I should leverage that and get you to book a trip to Dubai soon.  "

Your sweet nature, supportive and accepting attitude has been of great help in term 6. I hope life continues to shower you with great joys, and that the sun shines always bright in your life and of those dear to you. As we return to the corporate field, I wish you all the success.

As the name suggests he's quite a fun loving person. Member of 42, the literary club he's a big time GLOBE-master. Daga has always been at the receiving end of surprises and I guess he's got accustomed to it now. If Daga generously asks you out sometime, don't get excited, in all probability, you're gonna end up in some south indian restaurant. For me, he's like an elder brother always ready to help (that's when he's not sleeping because he actually is sleeping most of the time).

Himani takes time to open up with people but once she does she is the best person to hang around with.

All the conversations on Instagram about beautiful places and food were so much fun. Oh my god! What fun at Oktoberfest and your home in Toulouse. Will remember those days for life. You know so much about cuisines and places man, I learned a lot. Your mushroom baguettes are the yummiest. Always keep traveling, dining and cooking!         "

pgp31152,Kunika  goel,BCGvsMcK,CryBaby,, You are such a sweet person that your testimonials will be filled with great words. But I'd like to take this opportunity to complain about you. Kitna chillati hai yaar tu aur kabhi kuch meri baat sunti bhi nahi. Apne 'BADE BHAI' ki sab baatein sunni chahiye.
pgp31152,Kunika  goel,Dedicated,Perseverer,Champ,"If someone asks me, what does an IIM teach you, how does it take you better, I know whom I can point to. You came across as a distinctly dedicated girl during term 1, and I have told you how I was mighty impressed by your astuteness during the summers. There are not many who can live in this competitive environment, still learn, get better but not be tarnished. You are however a golden example Kunika. The day the rank list came out and I saw you were there in Top 10, the Section C topper, I was really really happy. If there was someone who I knew should beat me, someone who really deserved this, it was you. Others would laugh at this, but I'm sure both of us understand the significance of this. Your finals will be a tale told years on, but very few would know of the silent sleepy girl, who quietly took her notes, studied on time, worried (a lot), and came out on top of everyone. You're a champ for me, a real winner dude. Your innocence is what makes you special beyond these great skills, so always preserve that. Cheers to a great career and a great friendship :) "

You are the most hardworking person actually and the way you have grown, I feel genuinely so proud of you my girl. And you pack it with such innocence and sweetness is amazing. Your poems show how you remember such small details about people. Thank you baby for being with me for these 2 years, for teaching me, tolerating me, supporting me, sharing all with happiness and sorrows together, providing me strength. For all your slaps and abuses, your love for paan, toffees, our conversations, numerous kisses, I am ready to feed you as many peanuts as you want for my whole life.

pgp31152,Kunika  goel,Kuni,,,"Kuni. There are very very few people in this world for whom I feel utmost protective and no points for guessing that you do qualify as one of those. The reason why I don't feel the need to readily react when we talk or I rebuke you at times, don't fall for your emotional drama or act as a complete bitch is because I take you sister to me. The amount of love and compassion that you hold for everybody leaves me in awe. Having said that, I am glad that I could bring out that little monster that was hiding inside you. Also I am pretty sure that it targets me the most. With our own ups and downs and highs and lows, we have shared the best and worst of the times together.

More importantly, you've been there for me through all my trials and testing times, personal or professional. I know I can depend on you, and I hope you feel the same, too. I had never dreamed of finding a friend like you, and this friendship remains a highlight of my journey @HelL. Words fall short to describe all that I want to say, so, *fist-bump* *smiles* "

I can never forget all that masti we did together! We did cut out a bit in the second year, coz I got busy, we had different classes etc. But if ever I will think of IIML in the future, you are sure to cross my mind!

Others completely based on their on foot thinking while you always made a plan for everything you did on charts. Not only that you also tried to learn interface and phones and I guess only charts guy to take an initiative on the same. I guess you were one of the first guys I met on campus, courtesy induction, and it was your shirts which saved me for the first day. Never found anyone so helpful and eveready to take on responsibility, even when you were unwell. And you were always so god on taking the joke on yourself, needs a great character to do that. One of those i really respect here in Hell    "
pgp31154,Mihir Joshi,Sloths_be_ashamed,,," You have been the carefree spark in our group here at Hell. Your sheer enthusiasm towards things you like to do make me jealous.

This will definitely be true for any professional assignment that you take up in the future and I'm sure you'll keeping rocking whichever field you get into. On a lighter note, let's see how long you can afford to keep sleeping like a baby(18 hours a day). Hope to see you working on an entrepreneurial venture soon enough and if things work out and the solar sector brings us to professional crossroads, would love to work together* Cheers and all the best!   considering you'd have sorted your polyphasic cycles by then ;)            "

And remember whether you like it or not you will continue to receive them in future too. (Only reason that will result in discontinuation of the same will be either you tell me to do so or I find that it is hurting you) You are and will be my elder sister always. We have fought many times during these 2 years; sometimes seriously, sometimes for fun; but I enjoyed them. I got new takeaways and learnings from those fights. You have very good heart to gel with people and also ability to look at a problem or situation in structured way in order to come up with a solution. I like the way you try to find your happiness in small things. I respect you a lot and really wish the very best for you in all aspects whether its professional or personal life.

Our friendship began with tiny things like that. I admired your clarity of thought about what you want from life, and learned from it. I learned networking by watching you do it, Miss Hostel Representative, I-Know-Them-All! ;) You're so mature, yet you've managed to keep that inner child of yours alive through this HelL ride. Kudos! :D After life @HelL, I will definitely miss the day to day fun & banter we had together. Having you around feels like being at home, feels like 'family'.

Even after so much going on during 1st sem, how you managed the things with always a smile on your face was commendable and that is what inspired me the most. You were the one who inspired me to play squash. Even in the final placement season, you were so calm and composed. I definitely like that about about you. Hope our friendship continues after IIML as well. Stay blessed and keep in touch :)    "
pgp31158,NIKHIL YADAV,Yadav,,," I don't think you would have spoken to anyone in college as much as you did with us. You are pretty sorted and have this assured manner of dealing with turbulences.

We came across a long way- started off doing case competitions together and ended up competing in RPG, all the squash games we played together… I hope we do a lot of trips together for the common love of travelling that we share… The calm and self assured head you are, I know you will do well out there, All the best :)

I can't forget you nakhre on stex (Surbhi aaj pakore khane ka mann hai…plz bana de na  :D). when you were helping me make poori, ur expressions were epic. That Budapest club when you were dancing with the guy who proposed me was epic.

You were one of the first few friends at campus and I'm glad that we still share the same bond (even better actually).  You are the cutest person I know and probably the one with an extremely noble heart. I'm really good to miss our discussions and all the fun. As for you, you have a long way to go in life and I'm sure you are going to succeed at the path you wish to choose. All my love and wishes for your future.
Love,
Kanika     "
pgp31160 ,Palash Gupta,Excited,body,energetic," Paggu bhai. The most excited (over excited actually :P) and enthusiastic guy of our college. One of my first few friends as well. There is nothing that this man is not good at. Study (8 pointer), Case Competitions, Drama ( TB classes were so much fun with you :D), parties, PJs etc. etc. Your energy is very infectious. Best of luck for your consulting career and rock Accenture :) "
pgp31161,Paridhi Varma,Beautiful,Sweet,Intelligent," Before becoming friends with you I always thought you would be the same fragile, simple, sweet girl like any teenage would be. But lady you carry the ""Fire"" that brings energy to everyone who is around you. You are invincibly strong with the right balanced amount of decisiveness, intelligence, strength and beauty. You have the ability to reach greater heights in life and motivate people to do better in life. You resemble WOMEN POWER and you should not settle for anything less than what you deserve. I feel so wonderful that I have a friend who is just 21 but carried so many things for me to learn and inculcate. God bless you my lady love and SHINE LIKE A DIAMOND.   "
pgp31161,Paridhi Varma,Pari,,,"She is the most cheerful person I know. From our times together in Jaipur to now, this belief has been getting stronger. Carefree, vivacious & bindass are the words which define her. I cherish the time we spent during FIRE. Pari! the story that you told still inspires me. And I know we will be standing by each other for the rest of our lives. My best wishes are always with you. Keep spreading smiles as you do now :)    "
pgp31161,Paridhi Varma,Charming,Resilient,Cutie,You are my first friend on campus and I am glad we could maintain our friendship in this crazy campus. You are one of the most inspiring people I have ever meet and I hope we remain good friends for life. 
pgp31161,Paridhi Varma,Inspiring,Enthusiastic,Frienedly," I still remember the date when I first met Paridhi, it was 2nd of August of year 2015. I was feeling very different after interacting with her on that day. The reason is her enthusiasm and positive attitude towards everything. She is very good at communication and articulation of her thoughts. The summer internship period was so good as we spent really good time in Bangalore. I remember those evening chats in the cafeteria of office and lunches on the open terrace. You are always full of energy, that's what I like about you. I missed your performance during MV 2016, sorry for that. You are simply amazing and I wish you all the best for your ambitious goals and stay in touch. You are angel as per your name Pari. Keep smiling always.  "
pgp31161,Paridhi Varma,Pari,,,"You may be the youngest in campus (just 19 when you joined) but you are one of the most mature person I have seen. Your self-motivation, enthusiasm and zeal to overcome all odds is inspirational. You were always there to support me and lift my spirits when I felt down. I will always look out to see you achieve even more in life.   "
pgp31162,Prakhar Agarwal,Chill-max,,," One of the brightest and multi-talented guy I have seen on the campus. I am happy that we met during first month of IIML. Very easy to go along with and always happy to have you around me. I will miss our 'scooty party' at Fauji dhaba and other numerous places. 																																							
       "
pgp31162,Prakhar Agarwal,Cute,,,"Section C -> Bulla! The transition was very quick and wouldn't have been possible without you. I have amazing memories with you - cricket, carrom and a lot more stuff :P Never ever stop laughing and being cute also ofcourse stay the way you are always!    "
pgp31162,Prakhar Agarwal,Oversmart,Thorough,,"First interaction I believe was in e-sikander and my first impression was, ""kaisa chu... h"". Oversmart, trying to show off etc. Waise after controls impression hasn't changed much, but haan, you are one of the most hardworking and sharp guys I have met. you handled not only interface but also charts and at times ops with so much ease (ops guys in controls tent) it was really inspiring. PayTM ke waqt your research was astounding. And I have always wondered how you never made it. You deserve so much better. But I am sure with your tenacity, you shall do good.    "
pgp31162,Prakhar Agarwal,Dauno,Keval,,"He's a very chilled out guy and will offer you a joint (but keval joint hi nahi, he'll give you some free gyaan too ) at any time of the day. Made my life easier during our internship at RCap and let me rag him all the time :P Eating a meal with him was a big task – he's even more of a pickier eater than I am. Ours was an unlikely friendship for which I'm grateful nonetheless."
pgp31162,Prakhar Agarwal,Silent Killer,,,"During the 2 years in heLL, I have never seen you agitated. The way you handled everything so calmly is your greatest quality. Even while making comebacks to the arguments by Pranay, you remained composed which at times won the battle. The bakar sessions in your room is something which I miss a lot. "
pgp31163,Pranay Vimal,Genuine,Smart,,"Dost, I admire your honesty (both to yourself and to the world). From you I have learned importance of a good work ethic, of hard work and better understanding of people. Without doubt, you will be super successful in whatever you choose to do. :)                "
pgp31163,Pranay Vimal,Patna_ka_swagger,,,"The one person who made things feel like home around him, not to mention the ghar-ka-khana he used to supply! The patnaite with the heart of gold, he was my trustworthy, non-judgemental section-mate (and a partner in a certain 'activity' :P) Even if one didn't meet or talk to him everyday, Pranay Vimal was a 3AM friend. Blessed to know this 'star performer' :D                 "
pgp31163,Pranay Vimal,Logic,,,"Logic is the solution to every ptoblem in life and if you have any such problem, he's the man. You'll be bombarded with solutions (most being non sensical though :p). Also one of the most harwoerking guy I know who also has the perfect attitude towards life - **farak nahi padta mujhe! Stay the same...always!! "
pgp31163,Pranay Vimal,intuitive,resourceful,sensible," I became good friends with you when I became the extended Bulla :D before that u were that guy to me who said  girls are very soft and don't have a competitive spirit :P Then we became friends and I started coming to Ankur's room for teaching you guys. Ahhh I remember that night when I was teaching you all 8. It was horrible :D then the next I remember is suzed time..;-) and how you fucked up the Rachit's bday cake...so many dinner and movie outings...then the endless poker with you. The best part about you is that you always take things in a good spirit...stay the same. 
P. S.  We still have one date pending.. :) Love:Surbhi   "
pgp31163,Pranay Vimal,Modest,Pragmatic,,"My interaction with Pranay started before we even came to Lucknow. Even though our communication was restricted to virtual media, I could get a sense of the kind of personality he was. Modesty, pragmatism, astuteness reflected in his words. My perception became reality when we finally met. And suddenly I forged a special attachment with him. We share countless memories, mostly happy ones, spread throughout the two years. I can never forget our ""intellectual"" discussions over numerous cups of tea and plates of pakodas at Fauji. If I had to select the dearest people I've met here, he'll definitely be in the top 5. Even though we may be going on separate ways, our friendship will be on the same route till the end of the world."
pgp31163,Pranay Vimal,Pannu,,,"You were among the very few I knew even before coming to this campus and I cannot tell you how much of a relief it was to know someone who, you are sure, will be there for you no matter what. You are a friend who is always ready to help. I do not think that there will be slightest of impact on our friendship of the college getting end because as always we will find a way to discuss about career, life and families (my favorite topic remained stories of Pihu and Amaira). I so much want to say how much I appreciate you supporting me during Hepp, be it be with CV preparation or keeping me optimistic about the process, believing in me. Thanks! Hope we will always stay in touch and share stories of more nieces and nephews who are yet to be born!    "
pgp31163,Pranay Vimal,Bakar,Poker,FIFA,"The Pranay I knew during our BIT days was altogether a different person, or I didnt know you so well back then. But this year has changed my entire perception about you. You are the most Bakc**d person here, but at the same time most helpful as well. I know I will always have you as my backup whenever I am taking on anything."
pgp31164,Preetam Nayak,Writer,,, Gym and class are the two places where Preetam has managed to successfully maintain 100% attendance. One of the most sincere and genuine person I've met in campus. Always ready to break a leg and make parties lively. Wishing this writer(class notes) all the very best for his great future. Good Bye and Good Luck &#61514;           
pgp31164,Preetam Nayak,CEO,,," The reserved yet the one who will shout at the top of his voice when down with a few pegs... The love for ketchup, the love for gymming and making notes in tiny handwriting. You are a gem of a person. All the best bhai :) "
pgp31164,Preetam Nayak,Preetam,Nayak,Gymbuddy," At first I wouldn't have thought that I would become such close friend to this guy. Initially Preetam was seen in my section as a very shy guy, who rarely speaks and very Sober. But when our friendship started, maybe since we were both quite the chup chaap rahne wale ladke of the section, we had a real connect, boosted further over drinks and gym. You will be surprised, by the first few meetings you won't get to know but this guy probably has one of the best sense of humour in this campus.His jokes are so amazing, properly times, and not at all pathetic. I still remember the awesome mimicry he could make of some of the Profs and the other lot of students on the campus. He is little shy, but doesn't shy to praise about a pretty chick with his friends when he see them.He sweats in the gym and also when he eats!, which is so funny. I wish him all the best and I would cherish the parties we had together on campus.                  "
pgp31164,Preetam Nayak,Sirji,lieutenant,,"I dont know why but you always remind me of ""brock lesnar""... aur aapki hand-writing yaar mann na padega kya likhte ho yar best notes person.... Aap bahut down to earth ho and aapke sath kitne HEPP process aur project dekhe h mene... And koi bhi info ho college se related you are always my POC.. All the best sir for your career    "
pgp31164,Preetam Nayak,CEO,,,"The silent guy sitting at the corner, turned out to be one of the most humorous personality in the second year of this journey. Other than being a most humble and helping friend, you will also keep me reminding of your 4 day Veg and 3 day Non- Veg funda boss. Best of luck boss !!         "
pgp31164,Preetam Nayak,Strict,,, My bench neighbor . We are like a Tom and Jerry .We fight often but care for each other :-)    
pgp31164,Preetam Nayak,Calm,Caring,," Preetam, you are a calm, sweet and positive person.You work hard. Keep up the spirit. All the best for the future!  "
pgp31164,Preetam Nayak,palestrato,,,"  A palestrato! I didn't know much about during first year but I am lucky we became friends. One of the best handwriting I have seen here! Will remember the BAKAR we did on various topics during our Hukkah party at Dude's room!																																							
     "
pgp31164,Preetam Nayak,Lt.,,," Mr. Preetam Naik, the party animal in our group, the guy with great sense of humour and capable of doing mimicry of any professor. Sir walk, eat and drink like an army man and you can recognize him by just watching his walking style. 
Our Preetam Sir always breaks his past record in matter of drinking and has great talent of making neat and clean notes even when he is in sleep mode. Sir ke note ke wajah se hi mai term 4 me pass ho gaya. Thanks bhai for your notes.
Wish you all the best for your future career and growth ACME clean tech

pgp31164,Preetam Nayak,CEO,Fitness,Diligent,"A man of few words,CEO sir lets his actions do the talking.A stickler of rituals,he doesn't eat non-veg on 3 days(However,makes sure that he eats chicken biryani on the other 4 days!).A fitness freak,he hits the gym almost everyday.One of the best guys to party with because bhai ensures that no alochol is ever wasted. Academically brilliant,he's diligent,hard-working & will be an asset to any team he's part of.Thank you Preetam for being there for the last 2 years!Hope you land a business role in Manchester United soon!

          "
pgp31164,Preetam Nayak,Witty,Mature,Funny,"Sir CEO. His appearance is very very deceptive. No doubt a man of his words, and a sensible one too…. but a few hours into a party, and you'll witness his rangeen side. A great singer and life of the party. His humour is one to be in awe with, until it is directed towards you. A great friend to have, someone whom you can trust for the serious stuff in life, and can count upon to bring smile to your face.   "
pgp31164,Preetam Nayak,Wittiest,,," Preetam, You are one of the wittiest people I have ever met. So much laughter listening to your jokes. Keep it up :)          "

pgp31165,Prithviraj Radhakrishnan,CEO-material,Passionate,Industrious,"Toto's enthusiasm & passion towards application of knowledge in real-life contexts was a welcome break in the often boring case discussions in PGP-1.Diligent,curious & enterprising are the three words that define bro's thirst for knowledge.As someone who had already founded a start-up even before joining IIM,his insights did made the classes more meaningful.Bro,your potential is limitless.Wishing you all success in the years to come!

pgp31165,Prithviraj Radhakrishnan,Crazy,Foodie,Freak,"How does it feel to meet a person who thinks exactly the same way as you do. Met in the most random possible ways - the Entrepreneur Guy. Shared a common goal - to explore all popular restaurants and food from Lucknow. Prithvi I would miss all the awesome food & dining with you and sometimes your 2nd best person :D. 
The most irritating thing about you - you will never understand Hindi & irritate me with Tamil movies and videos. You have one of the craziest way of living. 
Still States, languages, culture & Food being uncommon - we have had many things in common. I will miss the long conversations about life and future - hope you learnt something from my experiences shared.
I adore the Kid in you - the way you want me to listen and solve all your problems.

I will miss someone by my side who always laughed at my jokes and who understood me better than myself sometimes. One of your strengths is to get results when you apply yourself and I am sure you will fulfil all what you dream once you do that. I wouldn't have visited Dastarkhwan or Nainital Momos so much if not for you and your love for food. You have so much love for your community and the will to make them proud that it motivates me. I will keep waiting for your calls and the future stories you share. All the best, my nigga :)

pgp31168,Rajani Kant,Bestie,Rajjo,,"RajaniKant is as popular-famous-known guy in the college just like his name. He is a true people person by heart. He is not like most MBA types focussing only on their own lives. For Rajani , the life and happiness of his loved ones comes before his own. This is because his life has made him like this, where people are dependent on him while he has been independent since the very start. I got to know Rajani first when we both were struggling to get shortlists in Summers. But Rajani never feared,since he knows he will make it Big in Life,and won't cry on small things for which most MBAs cry like that profile, that Grade, that CV point etc.He has come a long way in life right from his small village in Bihar. He wants to create his own ""EMPIRE"" one day, and I wish him all the Best for that.Very interested into Politics and football, don't know why he is into MBA. Rajani and I connect on a lot of things, like we both are quite same on the marks we get,and we both know how to make the right balance between party and work in the college.He is the first and one of the only persons I would share my secrets with.And I share everything since we have built a trust between us,that I think will be there forever in life                    "

But the first time I had a conversation with you in our wing, I knew we will be friends. Your handling of Chacha so that everyone can stay peacefully was quite commendable.

But jab section alag huya toh main bahut sad thi ab main akeli ho jaungi. But phir bhi hamari dosti kabhi kaam nahi huyi it increased day by day. Maine pi ke kafi bar taang kiya hai but I love you so so much. Har prob har cheez ke liye pehle tere pass aati hu. Placements ke time tu har waqt mere sath thi mujhe bahut support ki.

Thoughts shared,secrets bared, 'bitching', dirty jokes, giggles nobody else could understand..these and much more define this friendship. In her own adorable little confused way, she makes a permanent place in your heart. One feels cared for, and caring, protective and protected, all at the same time around her. And to top it all, this compulsively shopaholic lady imbibed a lot of 'fashion sense' in me.  Remember the times we dressed up and clicked a hundred pictures before stepping out of the room! :P Also,the common fear of all things supernatural only helped us in the long run :D. Differences of opinions, we had our fair share. But depsite everything, SOMETHING just held on. And i hope it holds on forever! To the first friend i made here, to my benchmate, to my study (and crime :P) partner, to those umpteen selfies..cheers! I will miss you, Saumya :) (BTW, i still want my free lifetime supply of honey)                                                "

Initially she and Aastha were like inseparable!.Saumya is a very smart girl, and a lot fun too. She always used to tease me with various things, and that used to make me so happy and blushing. Hehe.

You are the life of Sanki, I don't think anyone can deny that. No matter what happens, just stay the way you are and don't let anything pull you down.
The stories of your childhood, make me laugh and feel sorry for your ""Mumma"" and ""Mummy"" all at the same time :P When I share stories of helL with my other friends, be assured your name would pop up more than you can imagine.
The past one year, I have found a strong friend in you and looking at your past records, I'm sure we'll be friends till we are old and sharing the new filthy messages that are doing the rounds. Even then I can imagine you laughing with that WIDE smile of yours but sadly with no teeth :P Even then you'd be sharing the tales of how you terrorized your children. Even then I'd be in awe as to how such a small person can impact lives of so many people in the most beautifully chaotic way :D
But with all the ""childish"" things you do, one thing is sure – Whenever I need someone to get the sanest and most mature advice, I know you are one of the first persons I will turn to. 
Mattee..I love you! I'll miss you so much.   "
pgp31170,Saumya chaturvedi,GP,,," Saumya became 'GP' for insiders and the name stuck with her. She is one of those 'chota packet bada dhamaka' on campus. Always bubbling with energy and making weird faces and noises at all times. Interestingly, the face making sessions when captured make an exceptionally adorable collage. She will come up with really stupid hashtags and it will take a few minutes before you too will fall for the ingenuity of the idea. While it is difficult to take seriously a human half your size, she will make a profound remark every now and then which will always take you off guard. As a team player she is someone you would love to have on your side. With meticulous negotiation skills and a much focussed moral compass she can do incredible things for your team. Having said that, she could pick on you in the funniest possible manner. With a knack for singing she often breaks into a singing mode out of nowhere and the listeners are often left wanting for more. Fun Fact: She once collapsed onto the ground when a cake was hurled at her on her birthday. Survival Tip: Don't get into a verbal dual with her. You WILL regret it. Song Dedication: Fools who dream, La La Land. "

I don't know how Dolly and I would have passed our fin exams without you. Rachit you have done a lot for me and thank you for being there. You are extremely helpful, caring and just too sweet and ya lazy :P The journey from studying in Library to not studying at all was all worth it.

Your knowledge of fin is something that I envy you for. How many times have I seen you in class, answering a question perfectly even though you were caught sleeping, or using your phone. You only asked, ""Question kya hai"". And somehow you always knew the right answer. So, I know who to call whenever I need an answer to a tough question. "
pgp31172,Shivam Garg,Sweet,Caring,Understanding, The most caring and sweetest person. We share the same alma mater since BTech. His coaching during summers and finals helped me a lot. Thank you a lot Shivam...Loads of love.          
pgp31172,Shivam Garg,Good,,,"I never thought that we would become friends during our Summers and that it would continue to grow from then. We talk so much, it feels like there is nothing to write. My suggestion for you is to be positive always. My complaint is that you haven't told anything negative about me, yet.  "
pgp31172,Shivam Garg,Friendly,,,Though the Index group didn't do much but I got a new friend. Stay in touch. Good luck.

I always said your name in different and very low volume tone and u always repeated same.... I always laughed whenever you answered any queation in class, It is like this... STEP 1: you start your answer, STEP 2: 3-4 sec. silence, STEP 3: you clear your throat, STEP 4: once your throat is cleared you start globe... All the best for your future adventures    "

pgp31172,Shivam Garg,Silence,,,Listening is your forte and you've always been the silent but reassuring force in Alcom. With you I was sure the work would be done and there are few people I can trust to get stuff done. Thank you brother :)
pgp31172,Shivam Garg,Philosophical,,,"Shivam, a perfectly imperfect friend of mine! A person whom you will always find ready for help at any time of the day (or night of-course). He takes your problems to his personal space and even start worrying about it all time. He will listen your meaningless talks, will make you listen even worse of his but in the end it's all worth your time. He is always over-enthusiastic for pizza, party, food or anything fun. He also contemplates a lot about ay topic and tries to change the way things. He also never cleans his room and its difficult to stay in his room. So my dear Shivam, if any person is spending more than 5 minutes in your room, he/she is precious for you and dont let him/her go. In the end, congrats for dream job and all the best for dream girl (guy? :P).             "

pgp31172,Shivam Garg,Farzi Localite,,," Shivam is a localite (but the kind who has no idea about the city, and didn't even once was able to suggest any place to go or eat). I have taken him to more places in city, than he has been in his entire childhood in the city (I think so). One can find Shivam always roaming around campus (found more in girls hostel than in his own room :P).  "
pgp31172,Shivam Garg,Mental,,,"Mental – I would call him. Many people struggle with their thoughts but not Shivam. He has an ability not only to think coherently but also to bring it on a logical conclusion. You may find him roaming around and thinking something randomly and you may think he is a mental, as I did my first time, but I have found many creative ideas behind these random thoughts. Later I understood that he contains himself with his mental-mode otherwise he might explode. Kidding. All the best dude.           "

pgp31172,Shivam Garg,Achiever,,,"A person who always rely on himself for all work. Will always be found roaming with tensed and confused face, but that is his way to discover himself and improve further.

She's one of the biggest gossip girls (ofc, after our panchayati mausi!). Khurana is a party person and has extremely good taste in music, with her favourite song being 'NA NA NA NA' by J-star. A biiig foodie, she loves butter chicken @dastarkhwan and I wonder how'd she survive without it. With a bachelors and 3 years of work-ex, she claims herself to be 22 yrs old, but in reality, she has adopted some 2-3 kids at campus (including me) and hence is addressed as 'mom' by me :P.

Never going to forget that time. Keep smiling and stay happy always. "
pgp31176,Sukanya Arora,Gorgeous,Sexy,Beauty," Bro I still dont remember how we started talking.. You were my benchmate so I think it must have started from there. The first thing i can remember is we sitting together in the classes and judging people(u noe what for)  and laughing our asses out. How we  used to pass chits in classes to each other,  senti discussions on the paper sheets (I still have them all).  One most precious moment of ours is from my birthday night. I was so angry that u didn't come and then I found you locked inside my room. We had tears... Having you there was amazing... And since then you have become a very imp part of my life here... From online shopping to dinners in mess to classes.. U were there... Nd I have always complaint to u when u were not :P
I love u babes :* Love:Surbhi   "
pgp31176,Sukanya Arora,.,,,"Sukanya Arora. My first friend on campus. Actually, a friend even before coming to campus. We clicked with each other so soon! IIM Indore and IIM Lucknow interview processes, and then straight there we were at Dunkn Donuts, planning our next two years at IIM L. We even had a set of lies ready to ensure that the hostel allocation team gives us rooms next to each other ;) ! When I reflect back, I sometimes wonder how we managed to remain such great buddies even when our sections, hostels, and committees, were all insanely different. Infact, our bond became stronger in first year, and finally we became neighbours. We have had the best of times together : dinners (mess), parties, outings, shopping sprees, and so many more. Sukanya, all throughout these two years, whenever I have felt the urge to share something, you have been the first person to cross my mind! It's so damn easy to discuss anything and everything with you. Honestly, I can't imagine my IIML story without you. You are one of my biggest takeaways from campus &#9786;

I know, you count me as one of your best buds here, believe me, I do too. You are such a baby sometimes, but then that is what makes you SAUNIL. I secretly thank RA for he gave you this name, and we brought it into everybody's life. Your confidence is your strength. Jis tarah se tune apne CV m jagah chhood di thi wo yaad karke awesome lagta hai. We constantly talk about this quality of yours. Be in touch.  "
pgp31177,SUNIL AGARWAL,DCP_King,Vella,n,"Sunil aka Baap launda was the superstar of section C when it came to DCP (desperate class participation). Have done numerous mischevious things together at campus. Early morning bike rides to Fauji for tea and bun-maska to the bike ride to Gomti nagar for Lucknow marathon, we've done it all. Dudhwa trip with him was just amazing. Had we got to play our conversations here, 80% of them would've to be b**ped! A funny and gentle guy, he's one of those who doesn't take anything to his heart. He's one of the most trustworthy people for me and he's the one I'd call for help in any situation. We definitely are gonna stay in touch!            "

The guy who believes in networking obviously mostly with gals ;) I have always treated him like my kid that is the kind of fresher vibes he gives :p . He never misses any opportunity to discuss his childlike issues with me. 1 number marvadi and his funda of not going on dates with gals in college is 'Bill pay krna padta ha'. Only when I worked with him in the Amazon case, I realized how intelligent he is :p Hard to convince on anything until he understands it from his point of view. The svnit parties, more of which are also pending were fun with you. Our bond grew stronger over a period of time and you no longer are a fresher :p  
Cheers to SVNIT, our friendship and good times together!!
        "
pgp31177,SUNIL AGARWAL,Fresher,Energetic,Dedicated," His ever smiling face and childish innocence make him one special person in the hell. Sunil probably still loves his undergrad college SVNIT more than anything in the world. He can always be seen doing one thing or another for his svnit juniors. Apart from SVNIT, Sunil is also famous for his 'amazon' t-shirt which he has won in one national event. I thought he was gonna break some world record of wearing the same t-shirt for a longer period of time. But jokes aside, Sunil is very hard-working and always full of so many ideas. His zeal for marketing and fresher like enthusiasm helped him in many competitions and events. Though it didn't help him securing some lady luck for him. :P Don't lose hope buddy, you will surely do something extraordinary in life. Best of luck!                         "

Thank you for being your own self. Thank you for making us laugh at your Surati jokes.

I wish you all the best and hope you #swag never goes down. Cheers!   "
pgp31177,SUNIL AGARWAL,Saunil,Swag,FS," 'Saunil' as we like to call him is the guy who can come closest to Johnny Bravo in real life. He has all the airs of a typical fresher and will take offence is you say anything that puts Asian Paints in bad light. With a knack of asking questions in class to which the professors seldom had any answers, he never went easy on the guest faculty either. Despite all his lunacies, he has commendable networking abilities and you will be shocked to see his contact lists. I could never imagine him doing live projects in association with Professors at IIML and what more can you ask for if the project involves getting you loads of discounts at popular restaurants. I am yet to figure out how, but he has earned a name to be womanizer without actually dating a lot of them. The funny part would be to see him panic over trivial issues and stay ultra-chill about major issues. Fun Fact. He still remembers all his AIMCAT scores. Survival Tip: Try not to say your college is better than SVNIT, even if you are from MIT. Song Dedication: Chokra Jawan Rey, Ishaqzaade. "

Wish you all the very best in life bro.. stay in touch.. Message me, everytime you read this!   "
pgp31180 ,Sushman Das,Sush-man,Bro,,  Bro!! I have never seen someone else with the spirit like you have. Ab toh Abu Dhabi jaa rha hai ladka! yaad karte rehna! :)                 
pgp31181,Utkarsh Dangayach,Utku...,,,"One of the first PRiSMers that I got to know. Our journey together has been amazing…from Section D induction to PRiSMing together for two years, it's been a hel(L) of a ride! I will always remember you by the nicknames I call you (which mentioning here might get me in trouble :P). You have had faith in my abilities even when I lost faith in them. You have always been confident about me, even when I was at a real low in my life. Thank you for that. I would never forget the incessant pep talks I got whenever I reached out to you, and those have helped me look at life more brightly! Stay in touch :)         "
pgp31181,Utkarsh Dangayach,UD,,,"One of the best people on campus, he is always interested in helping and advising others. He is the quintessential HR person on campus...Incredibly passionate about marketing and I think has his dream job with Unilever, where I am sure that he will thrive. I have always admired his attitude and personality, and I am fortunate to be one of his close friends on campus. I was fortunate to be in the same night induction section as him and we hit it off straight away due to our mutual love for ""drinking"", partying and food. He is one person you can always count on to be in for a food outing. The only flaw in his personality is his love for Chelsea and I pray to God that he finds the one true path one day (Man Utd ftw!!!)         "
pgp31181,Utkarsh Dangayach,Smart,Hard,TRUE,"My friend since the beginning and till the end. Really surprising given the changes people have in friends here. Happy to have met him and shared the journey together. A genuine person otherwise we would have never gelled so soon. My sports partner, sorry couldn't win anything together. Will miss our sports quests, our discussions abut random stuff and being my support at IIML. Lots to say but I will let our friendship talk for itself. Thanks for everything UD :)   "
pgp31181,Utkarsh Dangayach,Tall,Handsome,," Man, you are amazing in your marketing knowledge and passion. It is good to see you eat and enjoy. I really liked talking to you, doing projects with you and bringing food for you. Thank you for all your support and advice. May your all dreams come true. Stay in touch               "
pgp31181,Utkarsh Dangayach,amante-del-cibo,,,Utkarsh comes as a level-headed person and sees the positives in every aspect of life. He is a food lover and an avid Chelsea fan - makes it a priority to watch every match.   
pgp31181,Utkarsh Dangayach,Assertive,Maretingguru,Kiddo,"One of the very few I met on the first day. Little did I know we would be in the same section. When people are looking for reasons why they need to specialize in something, trying to extrapolate their graphs, this man is one of the sorted ones in campus. Talk to him for an hour – he would convince you that marketing is not globe, oh and also that vegetarian dishes have many varieties. Standing beside him, you will constantly be reminded of your height, but soon you'd realize he's actually a kiddo. I have known him for much time here, and I can describe him as a person with integrity (I'm not kidding, he doesn't tell anyone's secrets to others) – where obviously, we all know - most of us fail. Too many things to say – foodie/caring/someone who doesn't reminisce (live in the past)/inoffensively funny. 
I'm not going to say any parting words here, because I know we will always stick around. "
pgp31181,Utkarsh Dangayach,rational,reliable,,"With you I cherish two special moments,  first during the summer placements... When u got placed and I came running to hug you but couldn't(lambu) and u picked me up instantly.  I don't noe why but this moment got registered in my heart. Next is my bday night. When I didn't see you at Amul I asked varun about you and he told me u r busy. I didn't feel good at all but then u were decorating my room the whole time even when u had plaster in ur hand. I will miss you. Stay in touch. :*

He's big time foodie and we've togethar made many restaurants run out of food (yes, we eat a lot, a lot!). Had a bike at campus, which was more mine than his (thanks to his broken shoulder :P). We've been on a lot many movie and dinner dates togethar (:P). Have partied a lot together as well. Banaras and Dudhwa trips with him were just amaziing.

Always keep that enthusiasm alive. Let's keep watching TV shows at the same time and discussing them whereever we are.

pgp31182,Varun Gupta,Gabru,,,"Gabru!! One of the most fun and active people on campus. It was great to have you as my neighbour for the 2nd year, your room being one of the most happening rooms of the campus. Be it parties, poker or general chit-chat, your room was the favourite hangout spot for the group. A testimony to this is the fact that we used your room to hang out when you had gone off to France for stex. 
In addition to this, you are incredibly smart and I have always admired your fun and happy go lucky attitude. It was great visiting Dastarkhwan countless times with you and the rest of the group. Thanks for these memories...one of the best ones we had in the last two years.           "
pgp31182,Varun Gupta,A,,," It really means a lot for me how you have always been there for me. We have had some really nice moments together that I can never forget, such as Surbhi's bday planning, prom in the first year, and Fauji & ice cream bike rides. From Dudhwa to Amsterdam, we have come a long way. I'll miss you Varun.. stay in touch :)"
pgp31182,Varun Gupta,Gabru,Punjabi,Fellow_foodie,"The first memory I have of Varun is of working with him on the BIO project group. Always trying to run things his way and trying to act smart! It was during Summers that I realized that all that was just a sham and that Varun in his ""Edward Cullen"" suit was a foodie just like me. The first party at his room was when I ended up being ashamed of how unorganized my room was. He is probably the reason I ever liked some of those Punjabi songs I never thought I would ever listen too. Ops classes and project were bearable only because of you :) I'm sure machaega tu at whatever village you will go to :P! All the best :) "
pgp31182,Varun Gupta,Tall,,, You are really sweet and it was always nice talking to you. I liked bringing food for you. Thank you for all your support. Keep smiling. Be in touch.              
pgp31182,Varun Gupta,Khabbu,Party Animal ,Jhakkas,"Thank you for being there. Keep eating, keep smiling. "
pgp31182,Varun Gupta,Gabru,,,Varun was among the first I met at IIM-L and was the source of my daily dose of Punjabi songs. He has an open-door policy for parties and led from the front-kept his room clean and well-decorated. He has a liking for fashion parades and walked the ramp twice.   
pgp31182,Varun Gupta,Gabru,SupplyChain,Foodie,"Gabru has played several important roles in this campus - food and beverage provider for all our projects, managing the operations of his parties, photographer and ""Krishna"" on student exchange. His positivity and level of enthusiasm for all good things in life is unmatched. 
His laugh brings joy to everyone around. Stay the same my fellow Dastar Khwan fan and unwanted son!                       "
pgp31182,Varun Gupta,Jolly,Lively,," My party room in first year was only your room. Those bike rides and random outings, I miss them. Dudhwa Trip, ah, last minute glitches but yeah it was all worth it.  Elephant ride, open jeep , winters, chai, maggi, road side dhaba, blue light in the mini bus, I remember all of it. When we met in Paris, I was so happy to see you. Trips were fun with you on stex. We had mini fights time to time but we always sorted them out. I am gonna miss you a lot. But I promise you, we are always gonna be in  touch.
P.S. friends for life and I mean it.

pgp31182,Varun Gupta,Partyplanner,,, Yo Varun! Never thought I would sing and dance to Punjabi songs but your DJ skills made it happen. You throw great parties and you are ever so full of life. You are a really good mix of fun and studious. All the best!        
pgp31182,Varun Gupta,.,,,"If the person who is reading this is not Varun or a girl, please don't continue reading, Varun won't like it :P  haha …Since I have read the testimonial you have written for me, I am going to take my badlaaaa :P So, this guy was the most social person in our entire exchange university. He knew everyone, and everyone (specially the girls) knew him. Infact, one day I randomly met a girl from the college on the bus, and there she was, busy praising Varun :P  Not to forget, the special dinner dates he used to have, when others were not allowed even in the radius of 100 km.  He is a beer and supermarket lover. He used to try beers of each city visited and had a collection of 100+ bottles. Also, he is a big party freaaak. Anyways, Varun, it was good to have you there at Acobha! You are a full-on-energy type of a person, never at peace, and always upto something or the other! It was fun gossiping with you. And ya, you are a great cook &#9786;

Had a lovely time there, had an epic time here. There are too many memories to put in text here and hence I won't even try. Thank you for taking me out to city so many times during an otherwise depressing time in Term 6. Your company has been a source of immense joy. Though it never suffices, but thank you for everything Paaji. Lucknow ke baad bi Jalwon mein kamin nahin aayegi! Let's catch up soon post IIM!

pgp31183,Vidhya  Velpandian,Warm,Talented,Strong,"A gem of a person, multi-talented with a beautiful heart. I have known very few people who have excelled at everything they do and yet remain grounded. I think she taught me more excel than the ITC course ever could. And yeah, loads of card games and some nice Tamil slang. I would always cherish the wonderful time we spent in Kuwait: bullying that one innocent soul in our group, teasing the smart-ass guys, cooking dinner, waiting eagerly for Friday afternoons for the wonderful Kerala Biryani at Bayan's and trying to make head or tail of the complicated data for the internship project. The thoughtful gesture to protect my painting from the dew during the artstrokes exhibition, the excel help for company tests and the awesome camaraderie we shared during MV 2017, these memories will stay with me forever! Wishing you loads of luck and Louuu (*Blink* Blink*). Stay Blessed! "

pgp31184,Vundavalli Deepika,Cheerful,Prettywoman,FinGod,"Singer, good cook, fin god, make-up enthusiastic, budding photographer – this woman has many angles to her life. She is a very private person, but only her friends can tell that she is one of the coolest in the campus. You've been an amazing friend during all this time. You always find her with either her Mac laptop or a MAC lipstick. She is a make-up enthusiastic, always well-groomed and well-dressed most of the times, unlike many of us here. I've been lucky in that sense tasting many of her recipes. She is that someone who tells ""kuch bhi karenge"" in a project and ends up doing it accurate to the most granular level. No one can decode how she functions on lesser sleep
""It doesn't really matter"" is her line for most of the things. Maintaining a balance between caring and being intrusive is what many of us get wrong, but she seems to get it quite right. I'm not going to say any parting words here, because I know we will always stick around. "
pgp31184,Vundavalli Deepika,Independent,Exceptional,Reliable,My earliest memory of Deepika is asking yours truly(who used to be always hopelessly sleepy in Term-1!)  not to worry about the FRA project submission as she'll take care of it.Few people know about finance concepts & cocktail concoctions with equal ease as Deepika ! Awesome our parties were because of her! Her exploits during STEX(and especially during Oktober Fest!)still provide fodder for our party conversations.Thank you Deepika for being an awesome friend !Never change :)

You were one of the calmest and brightest people I saw on campus, and one person who beat me to time spent in library in first term, which I believe you still do. I still remember how you would do a nightout and sleep after breakfast at a point of time in first year. But your dedication is something that I have always respected, be it acads, controls or basketball. I guess one of the calmest guys in controls, the way you would soak in pressure and still stay calm is really commendable. One of your biggest (and irritating ) superpower was gcatching my bluff/globe whenever I tried giving one. Irritated the hell out of me, especially when the third person was buying my story.    "

You have always been there to help me through my thick and thin.  all the trips have been wonderful just because of you. You were my all time partner for insti parties. I remember how you helped us in the XIMB competition and even skipped your meal for it. Many subjects wouldn't have been fun without you like leadership clinic & international marketing. I feel you, when you have to dictate your name's spelling to most of the people. you were the first person at hell whom i shared a secret with. you are one wonderful wingy to have, despite the fact you lured me to a very bad hostel.

pgp31189,Anamika  Gupta,Hygiene freak,,,"The girl who can easily provide cleanliness goals to everyone in the campus, possibly consumes highest number of tissue paper to ensure the optimum hygiene of her surroundings. Her heightened level of anxiety for studies will often make you introspect and gauge your level of callousness for the same :D. 
Her endless online shopping can even make the delivery guys at Gate-2 recognize her by name :P. Her penchant for novels and movies can make her stay awake for 2-3 days at a stretch. Her perfect sense of humor (call it PJ) can make your day

Amul, GnB and NJT can safely attribute their success and higher revenues to this one man alone. In fact, if rumours are to be believed, GnB is going to name their points system (Khaana Khao Points Paao) as ""Maha Points"" to honour him. He has never seen how early morning looks like (except for quiz days). And to top it all, he has been an excellent party host with multi-colored lights and high volume music creating an unforgettable experience.

How about we change that by you paying me a visit in Dubai. :) All the very best for all your future endeavours! "

pgp31194,Ashish Kapoor,Hagrid,,,"It was serendipity that we landed in the same CFM group. You brought some stability to my life because, well, you are boring. I have had ridiculous fights, and perhaps the most rational conversations with you on campus. The long conversations we had during internship despite the hectic schedule or being in different cities were a source of immense relief for me. You ensured we remained one of the most loyal patrons of Percussion, Karim's & Moti Mahal to name a few. Your room was our living room, where we used to chill even in your absence. Our constant bickering & nagging has been the defining element of our friendship - something I am sure will never cease to exist.                "
pgp31194,Ashish Kapoor,Great_Friend,,,"My first encounter with you was during summer placements when you sat in hall 1 till all our classmates got placed, trying to help people as much as can and you are still the same (you worked harder than Rohan for his placement :P). You are a great friend who is always there to help, support and guide me; an amazing host, we can't think of any other place to sit and chat apart from your room and yes its true that everyone in our group is more comfortable in sharing their problems and joys with you than anyone else.

These two years, I've seen the side of yours where there was so much partying that 3 of us broke your bed to the side where you gave a beautiful 15-minute lecture on meditation to calm my mind down. We had fun when life was happy and simple in the first year. We've been through turbulent times in the second, and it was you due to whom I did not lose hope. You were always ready to fight for the truth and for justice for all. Even when you were dealing with these problems, you lent me an ear to hear my woes and to calm me down each time. For that, I'm really grateful. You have been a really dear friend. Thank you :)     "
pgp31195,Ateev Gupta,LevelHead,Optimist,,"Ateev!
He's not just another sharp chap around here, but a very good person at heart. Also, a very strong person mentally. His interests outside academics – acting and photography are things which are very dear to his heart. There is a huge transformation one could see in him in these 2 years of time. I've seen the jolly-side of his and also his philosophical side, but anywhere in this journey, he didn't forget to be as awesome as he is. It's a shame we didn't get to spend more time, but well, quantity of time was never a metric. He is a warm and welcoming person, which makes him even more special. Wish you nothing less than the best in everything that you do. Jaldi shaadi karle – tere ghar ayenge phirse :D

And you have lived upto that. In terms of knowledge, I have seen very few paralleled. Controls was a great time, especially the slangs, which I guess were only second to DM.

On a serious note, you are one of the hard working and dependable guys i have come across. Dont forget us after after becoming CM. All the best and have a great future."
pgp31200,Deepak Yadav,Powerhouse,Atheletic,Friendly," The Sakht launda, Daredevil of Hell's Devils, or simply Yadav! Though we were in the same section but Yadav was introduced to me by Atul in the mess. He was giving 'gyan' being Babaji and I knew instantly that we were on the same wavelengths. I am glad that he took the right decision while choosing between FMS & Hell. Yadav is the real powerhouse, omnipresent in a number of games, a regular gym-goer, always ready for political discussions and who can do the bhangra better than him. His signature step is keeping both hands in the air and then shaking his head both sides like a wild man. With his extremely friendly nature, he connects with everybody very easily and believes me, he can do anything for his friends. Even Indian government recognized his worth and allotted an airport for his town. The funniest thing was that the runway passes through his home's roof as an overbridge. He once told in the class that he want to be the prime minister of India one day but already many 'raja' in the college knew that Deepak worth his salt. Good luck for your future buddy! Hope to see you in top leaders list one day!                        "

Just like it was scary to ride with Tambi, it was equally reassuring to ride with you (not many can handle a bike the way you do). You heath freak attitude to the laid back chilling out person I shall always remember. Times were fun with you, and with your attitude, I am darn sure you shall achieve whatever it is you wish to.

 "
pgp31203,Hemanth Basavaraju,Hellrider,Tambi,Funny,"Tambi probably was one of the very first friends, I have in the college. We always find him very amusing with his hard hand in Hindi speaking, his alleged relationship with certain poor Agarwal of our group and his constant connections with the female population of the hell. If one should really want to know how it feels in the hell, he/she should go on a bike ride with him. With his passion for bike-riding and his special attachment with trucks on the road, no ride with him can be lesser than a roller coaster ride. Probably that's why in past two years many girls were his pillion rider. The other reason was his simple and charming nature which make them feel very 'safe' with him. He is a complete momma's boy and will give the daily progress report at home including each and everything. Though we hit some rough patches in this journey, but I am happy he showed big heart and forgave me. Nonetheless, he gave us ample opportunities to crack jokes and share laughs amongst our friend circle. It should be made the punishable act for girls calling him Tambi. Hemanth please take your eyes off from 'rish', there is more in this world to make you happy. I wish all your pillion riders a very good luck! Keep rocking!                    "

pgp31203,Hemanth Basavaraju,Decent,,,"Yo Tambi. One of the most decent guys I have met on campus. You have a patience and a decency to accept when something has run its course is something I respect. There were a few bad choices and situations, but that is part and parcel of life and see how much of a better person that has made you. You have the patience, perseverance and tenacity to do good in life. Just a friendly suggestion to not get derailed and distracted easily, one of the few flaws you got. But it wsa always fun hanging out with you, and really heartwarming if you ask me, your personality was.    "

You are empathetic, sincere and a pure soul and you give serious goals to all those people out there. Your excitement during Mumbai, our constant banters during all the case study competitions, your fan clubs and the secrets of your near ones, your sleeping habits, your SBN painting selling stories : I have probably more to write but i am restricted  by time and space. Though your music and movies taste isn't the same as mine, but it has been fun watching movies and listening to songs with you. It has been fun looking around your room and making you throw some secretive stuff above your cupboard. The church visits and the visits to local cafes especially colours has been fun. Thank god you were a neighbour during the first year. You are fun to talk to and a very social person. never change for the world. thank you for keeping safe all my secrets.

pgp31205,JARETH LYNGDOH,Innocent,Charming,Faithful,"The evergreen fresher, one of the most devoted person, innocent & charming- That's Jareth. I still remember how all of our sections girls were shielding (Isse chhune se phle hmari lash pe se jaan hoga) him on his birthday in order to save him from getting birthday bumps. Jareth has this special habit of asking the question at the very last moment of the class and this makes him 'favorite' of many. His habit of calling girls ""ma'am"" was very amusing for us and nightmare for the girl. Fortunately, we spent almost two months together during our summers. He is one of the laziest people who can sleep right after taking a bath in the morning, that too after sleeping for more than 8 hours on the last night. One thing which I like about him the most is that he never takes offense of my jokes and silly remarks but replies only ""kitna ganda hai yaar tu"". I hope I didn't make your stay in Noida very miserable. Though I am still angry you didn't invite us to go to ""lord of the drinks"".  You are a very positive and optimistic person buddy. Never lose this spirit and your beliefs in the almighty. Your slapping incidents in metro and cinema hall still make me laugh like a mad man. You are awesome kiddo. Good luck for your future!                "

I still cherish the memories of doing all those cases - those night outs, those fights and pulling each other's legs. I think you must have been tired of me picking on you again and again. But you have to bear this for the many years to come. Just like you came to know about the evil me, I also came to know about the sarcastic Jareth. I never knew you could be funny, let alone sarcastic. I might not agree with you every time, but I will always support you know matter what. And I'm sorry for being bossy (I know you wanted me to write this). I wish you all the best for your future. I know you will get what you deserve. Be happy always.     "

I have hardly met anyone who is as devout in his beliefs, honest, avoids conflicts at all costs.

pgp31207,Kiran Amoghimath,Gentelman,Wise,Respected," Mr. Respect, a helpful friend and as we fondly called him-Katta! You might not remember it but I gave you this name after watching Baahubali together. In the college full of guys, Kiran was the one of few gentlemen. In fact, I've never seen him losing his calm in the last two years. Though we made fun of time and again but he always took it sportingly, laughing with us. From every 'brick' to the 'cloud' of the hell's 'universe', his 'soft' presence can be seen everywhere in the campus. The number of on-campus competitions or events, in which he didn't take part can be counted on the fingers of one hand. If any of us ever needed any help, be it projects, class assignments, interview preparations or any other matter, Katta was the unanimous choice. His vast knowledge, sharp mind and calm & composed nature distinguished him from others. He came out of his shell in the second year and became more fun. I heard his favorite dish was a certain type of 'egg roll'. Had ""Captain America"" been an Indian phenomenon, Katta would be the only choice. A true gem of person! I am sure one day you'll achieve such heights, we can boast of you in our children that you were our fellow batchmate and friend.                       "

pgp31207,Kiran Amoghimath,Respect,Katta,10," *Charansparsh* It is impossible to meet a humble person like you katta! You always listen to other person, never show off, and are always ready to teach. Always putting group's interests over your own, that's why we call you Katta the ultimate sacrificer! Make sure you don't forget us when you become the CEO. So let me embarass you for one last time: I still have the screenshot of your browser history. Oh, and say hi to leena. Also, Maharashtra ka tax bhardena Dharwad ka XD            "
pgp31207,Kiran Amoghimath,#respect,Katappa,,"Katta bro #respect. One of the most respected and mature people I have met on campus. Your maturity and kind nature struck me in the first few days itself. The accidental marketing group which was the beginning of something great. Your plans of parties, the sober guy who handled everyone and also the party animal pepping up the party in later occasions. At the same time, your marketing and competitions prowess, and all those case competitions. I shall never forget the SPENT quiz we won together, one of my best memories on campus. The parties we had will always be cherished and you shall remain one of the most respected persons on campus    "
pgp31207,Kiran Amoghimath,Sirji,,,"My partner in crime at Axis Bank during summers. A great human being, very calm and composed always willing to consider everyone's opinion and never imposes his own. A true yaaron ka yaar. Will always cherish those post dinner discussions at Shivaji park and Dadar chowpatty. Keep rocking Sir. #Paaylaagu    "
pgp31207,Kiran Amoghimath,Respect,,," katta you have become the synonym to respect in our minds. You are always the ice breaker between people and makes the party alive all the time. You don't mind taking the long route to give company to your friends, that's something that I admire about you. Parties we had at IIM L and Mumbai (broken lamp @Axis acco, pubs) gave a lifetime of memories.

pgp31208,Komal Havelia,Hardworking,Private,Awesome,"Komal, you were one of my closest friends in PGP 1, before we got busy during the internship and got busy in second year. I'll be forever grateful to you for all the help extended in launching Sumrise, its marketing and what not. Also, fresh in my mind are the numerous campus walks we had and so many random discussions we had. I am sure you'll do great in your career. Wish you the best in life, and especially for the second MBA from an Ivy League University. :)                  "
pgp31208,Komal Havelia,Shy,sensitive,consultant,"Probably one of the good (will not use best.. You know why :P ) friends I had on campus and I hope this would continue in the future. I believe we instantly connected the day we met just after MCC selection and after that the friendship only grew. From discussing crushes (mine only) to every other random discussion other than MCC work and trying to irritate you by telling random names as your crush :D.Thanks a lot for all the prep talk and all the motivation during CV reviews and Summers, it was really helpful. There was a time when we used to talk almost daily and shared almost everything ( you know what all! ) and helped with the problems. Although it reduced considerably in the second year due a very particular habit of yours... Yes.. you guessed it right.. and I still am not able to understand why do you care so much about what others are thinking. Seriously why in the world do you!!. But then no matter what ( and how hard you try not to :P ) but we are and still will be best of friends. I am really happy that you got into consulting as you desired and all things worked out just fine for you during/after the 4th sem. I know that you will achieve great success in life. Stay blessed and if possible, keep in touch :)    "
pgp31208,Komal Havelia,Sweeetest,Donalduck,n,"We became friends mostly around the time we were about to go for Stex, as we were both going to the same university. Komal is the sweetest person I have ever met till date, extremely polite and cooperative. She's sooo sweeet that an Italian guy just fell for her (love at first sight <3). The 3 months spent on stex with her were really nice, more so when she suddenly learnt cooking one-day :P. She's one of those people whom I'd always want in my project team irrespective of the course. She can survive only on cheese and coke for days. She loves to get her photoshoot done and not pay for it (she owes me 23 beer pints and 150 bucks). I am really happy to have met her. It was great knowing her and I hope we'd remain in touch! PS: She has some really cool GOT stuff in her wardrobe, do check it out sometime ;).                                        "
pgp31208 ,Komal Havelia,Reason_to_smile,Cutest,Kid,"Komal, I had never imagined the first time I met you that the bond between us would grow so strong. A casual interaction mysteriously grew into a friendship so exciting that it took us on adventurous journeys around the globe. The funny thing is that none of our outings or trips went as planned (thanks to envious rains, chilly winds, broken mirror and unlucky robbers) but never did we miss a chance to enjoy to our fullest. Be it the 2 month long summer internship or the first few weeks of student exchange, distances could never and will never become a constraint between us. Anytime in my life when I will ponder upon these two years at IIM Lucknow, the countless beautiful memories I have collected in your company will be the first things that will come to my mind. You're the sweetest, the cutest and the most caring people I have ever come across. The way you help and support others by going out of the way, makes me admire you even more.  In a nutshell, I can just say that my life at IIM Lucknow would have been incomplete without you.            "

pgp31209,Luxmi .,Chaivinist,Rebel,Emotional," Free souls are rare but you know it when you see one. I've read this quote but understood only when I met her. She is one of the carefree & extremely extrovert types. Either admire her flight from the ground or fly with her, just don't try to cage her. Though her laugh reminds you of ""Janice"" from ""Friends"". Sleeping in the class and getting caught by Profs, again and again, was the usual sight in the first year classes. Intentionally or unintentionally, she always said the wrong words at the wrong times and became the center of many jokes time and again. Though this idiotic exterior is a perfect coconut shell for the very emotional girl she is at heart. I've witnessed a few such stories after parties. But nonetheless, she made all the parties livelier with her never-ending energy and dance moves like Jagger. She loves the smell of books & tea and can sketch & draw decently. One should caution not to make her angry or hurt otherwise only god can help you. With her networking skills, open nature and marketing skills, she'll definitely achieve heights in her career, I've no doubt about that. Be fearless in pursuit of what sets your soul on fire and you need not to being dependent on anyone for that.                          "
pgp31209,Luxmi .,Hero,,," You were one of the first people I met here at the campus. It was fun knowing you; always enthusiastic and cheerful, the I-don't-give-a-damn girl, and most importantly not superficial. Whatever they say, go pagal!            "
pgp31209,Luxmi .,Bro,Bhand,,"Tu bro h yaar. I guess only girl I can say that. You are one hell of a bro. The ""Fresher"" taunts, the taunts on almost everything I did, the hundreds of arguments and yet being the adorable friend, you really were the coolest girl on campus. People will tell you have attitude problem and all that, DONT Frigging Listen. You are cool and stay as you are, just ego kabhi kabhi sambhal lena, baki sab thik h (sirf achcha hi bolun kya, itna bhi boring nhi hoon). Somehow you used to trigger creative part of my brain, ""30 hrs train journey"" will remain one of my best dialogues which you triggerred. Without you parties would have been so less scary, and at the same time so less fun. 1250 characters aren't enough, so will end. Love you bro, stay as you are.    "
pgp31209,Luxmi .,Dabang,,, You can guess from that days conversation when I had asked you whether you are from mechanical or some other branch. Your Dabangness is difficult to match even for few guys.

If he is not doing that then he is probably feeding the puppies, taking care of GnB or simply playing chess. I know him cz he was my neighbor in section D. He used to bring chocolates for the all the girls in the class. So, it has always been about food with him. He is just a call away to help you be it last minute studies for the exams, arranging anything or simply playing chess. You won't see him in parties much because he is like Akshay Kumar, who sleeps early and wakes up early. A man with a discipline. Have learnt a lot from you Giri.

I still remember how you pestered me to call Harihara and provided me with so much material to read before HUL IT interview in summers, although later I screwed up.You have been really a cool person to be with and talk to.

This person strikes across anyone with his amazing eyes. A sharp chap in discussions and absolutely one of the most efficient people I've come across. No wonder you chose a firm which nurtures/values it. You made this place so much better for me in many ways. Just the sense of having you around here is an unquantifiable parameter. Probably, the one person among a couple of them who can tell what mood I'm in, just looking at my eyes. I've been friends with him for more than 7 years now. A wonderful, cheerful, and inquisitive person with multiple follow-up questions. He can annoy you sometimes with his arguments, but you also would always know he is a great chap at heart. The purest form of pearl you may find in this campus. I'm not going to say any parting words here, because I know I will stick to you for life. Much Love.

We have together handled some difficult people at 3 am in the convocation ground. Fatso, while people might just know your bossy side, I have seen your thoughtful, diligent and carefree side as well.

The dreaded look on your face when you had to study for QAM. Your shocking resilience to my bad jokes. Your endless inquisitiveness and capacity for class participation. Your affinity for challenges, mental or otherwise. And how proactive you are. You've been one of the most refreshing and fun people to talk to, because you're the only one I know of who can talk about serious stuff, passtime stuff and all that girly stuff with equal ease (makes me want to wish I'd taken up debating). I also remember how you tried to help me learn accounting/marketing concepts in the first 2 trimesters, and I regret refusing your help initially. It's been a lesson well-learned for me. Remember I once told you that there are only a few people one can actually call one's ""friend""? You're one of the best friends (and let alone just a friend) I've ever had, which is no small feat considering how difficult to talk to I can be. I hope we stay in touch, and I wish you all the best for your future and a great career ahead. Also, don't forget to let me know whenever you plan to visit India! "

We have spent so much time together, we should totally leave our boyfriends and date each other. I love the fact I can say and bitch about anyone with you without fear of you judging me. You taunt me the most, and understand me the most as well. Our endless CC time, study and project sessions, our cute pictures, our morning walks and sunrise together. I will always remember the fact however insanely busy you were office, you managed to meet me, our flame shots, your night stay at my birthday, my parents love towards you, we totally are sisters.

You were there for me every single time I have needed you, be it when I was super happy or super sad. The way you excel at everything you touch and your understanding of people is plain awesome. Some of my best memories with you are: eating freshly plucked guavas from trees behind Bodhigrah, talking on Hostel 16 terrace when my section was partying and I felt lost, taking photographs on H-12 terrace in the rains, our Imambara trip, doing countless quizzes and projects, and so many more! Thank you so much for being my friend, Nehaarikaa. Always, always be in touch and know I'll be forever there for you :)           "

Very straightforward,  very smart, this lady never had any news of the campus (how i loved acting all 'informed' before you!!!)

You are the first person I go to whether it is for any sort of problem, confusion or a good new that I want to share and it will remain the same forever :)

So many things come to my mind when I think about you and the time we've spent. Shopping trips, late night chats, case discussions, meeting deadlines at the last minute, running for classes, bugging you while you were in deep sleep, dancing at the parties and what not! These two years have been is the most enjoying time that I spent with you. We have cried together and together we have laughed like crazy. 'Ladki kar gai chull' and 'chitiyan kalaiyan' is totally incomplete without you.
There are so many things that I admire in you. Speaking out upfront for things you believe in, your chilled out attitude and most importantly your puppy face look,
Love you forever! :*     "

I admire your persistence and zeal to carry on against all odds. You never shy away from trying new things and going crazy at times and I like that about you. Its something common between us and it was great working with you as a team. We became good friends along the way. Looking forward to an amazing trip.   "

pgp31219,Prerna Batra,Bestest,Buddy,Friend,Hey Prerna.. I have never met a person who can not only do multiple things at the same time but also who can handle multiple emotions at the same time. Surely I would like to learn that from you. My journey here  would have been really different if I had not met you three. I will remember our jokes and laughter which we had (Jokes on Aks and Soms). Beside that you are an awesome human being and you care for your friends(sometimes it does not look like that :P ). We together are awesome and can bring any party to life :D.      
pgp31219,Prerna Batra,Ultimate Poser,,,"The girl who is apt for the song ""Tu Kheech Meri Photo""; can mould her pose with ease like a chameleon when she notices the flash of the camera. She is a heartthrob in social media with at least 500+ likes in every upload of her's (which can indeed be a spike in her CV :P). Her 24*7 exuberant attitude makes her the life of every party. In spite of being involved in multitude of activities and being engrossed in her mobile all through the lectures, she can produce the perfect globe in the exams which makes her the topper in all HR subjects.
You made my journey @Hell a lifelong memory 2 cherish. Wish you good luck girl! May you reach miles in all your endeavors 

"
pgp31219,Prerna Batra,The_Smart_Girl,,,I am always amazed by the fact that you are always so carefree but then always in control. You are definitely one of the most intelligent and smart persons I've ever met. You are at your best when you are pushed against the wall and thats something I really admire about you. All the best in life Prerna.  
pgp31219,Prerna Batra,Stalking,,,"Thank you for being the most wonderful neighbor and friend. You are the first friend I made in section D.

pgp31219,Prerna Batra,Nautanki,Fb,Bubbly," Bold, bubbly, sporty nature & a total nautanki- in short a complete DCE product! Being a Delhi girl, she was the most fashionable girl of section D. She was so into fashion that at one point in time, she came dressed as Suniel Shetty also. :P But jokes aside, she is the perfect example of beauty with brains. The 'Airtel Girl' was the heart of 'Abhivyakti' with her very expressive eyes. She is a great fun to be with and knows how to laugh hard. She loves to get clicked and keeping one hand in her hairs is one of her many signature poses. She has single handily uploaded more pics on FB & Instagram than the sum of photos uploaded by our entire batch. Many of us have urged her to simply put the google drive locations of the pics. I hope you still remember our 'nail marks' poems sessions and I still don't why you were pointing at me in one of the class photoshoots. Prerna also loves to travel and visit different places. She never refused any outing invitation no matter if someone is going out of the station or simply visiting the city to eat some food. You deserves better and I wish you get everything you desire. Laugh much, love a lot, be free, be you. Gud luck girl!                     "
pgp31219,Prerna Batra,Energetic,Chatterbox,," The over-energetic, over-talkative, over-dramatic girl. Your energy is very infectious. I would give you credit for making all the plans and convincing everyone to come. Hats off to you. And because of you, we all have started taking so may pictures. Initially I thought you are a pakka vala free rider. But while working with you I realized that you are more serious about everything than we are. I have seen that other side of yours (The perfectionist one) that others have not seen. We became good friends just by making fun of each other. It is because of you that we all have some very nice memories. And thanks for making me do stuff that I was always afraid of (Remember that scary ride). You are awesome.     "
pgp31220,Ragi  G R,Happy,,,"I have always seen you smiling. No matter what. And I know how you have survived and taken care of a particular common friend.

I could enjoy onam just because of your invitations for 2 years. your advice has helped me a lot always. i remember watching horror movies together at night in the 6th hostel. You helped me so much during summers; ensuring i was awake and attending my interviews on time. You have given me fashion advice, life advice which i still follow. Diwali 2015 was fun only because of you. The memories of our visit to bbq, dandiya night and lucknow darshan will be treasured by me for long.

Neha and Nehaarika have been our two connecting factors when we started our journey in Bombay and since then my life on campus took a new turn. I know we have one more connecting factor (D – discussions) that brought us together but won't elaborate on the same now :P :P. Coming back to the campus in second year became a less worrying factor in your company. Thankyou for understanding me when I needed you. My survival in Bombay (even though for 15 days) became possible with you around. That roommates relation – cooking for each other (Maggi, thapela hi sahi :P), cleaning utensils for each other….all actions became effortless in your company. Our gossip or general awareness sessions (for me :P) as you may call them made our discussions more lively everytime we sat together. Be it the competitions or the projects your attitude further inspired me to work in your company. With your sense of humour it became easier to be with you. A person whom I can share my personal life with, your sense of understanding helped me be more comfortable and feel to be in safe hands. Caught by the placement tensions, our talking time might have reduced bu concern for you didn't. Bombay abi baki hai ;)  "
pgp31222,Ramanjot Kohli,BestFriend,CrazyMax,OzoneCapital,"You've got eyes of innocence, the smile of a child and a heart of pure gold. 1st year was all about staying in hostel 6 with you, miles away from my room in hostel 12. Your silent company has been as comforting as our deep conversations. You trigger my crazy streak, and exhibit yours through the frequent panic attacks you have had across these 2 years – 'Waheguru Waheguru Waheguru.' You are always up and enthusiastic about things – be it ladies night in your 'private balcony' or coordinated dance moves in the cab or sharing amusing stories of your neighbors (own very own Narang uncle), friends, and even their soft toys. Be it shopping online or in the city, be it dancing in the room while studying or in parties, be it laughing together or laughing at each other – I have so many memories to cherish.

From not knowing each other in first year, we became best frinds by the end of IIML stay. Aloo Parantha and pav bhaji in Night mess, competitions and classes and random gossips are only few of many things I will cherish about her. Beauty with brains and always going out of her way to help others.Hope you achieve all that you desire in life prom partner.  "
pgp31222,Ramanjot Kohli,Funny,Sikhni,,"Your expressions and the way you talk about even the simple things are hilarious. If there is someone who can match up AIB's Tanmay Bhat's comic timing is you. I can just sit with you for hours and laugh non-stop. 
You are a true Punjabi, full of life and enthusiasm and a big time foodie. We met on the first day at college and instantly hit off. We've shared so many memories together. Our problems and struggles and moments of happiness. You are and will always be one of the most special person ive met on campus! You are one of the most hardworking people I know and I'm so sure your persistence and dedication will take you to places. I wish all the success and happiness for you. 
I will always remember 'your private balcony', your train travel stories (uncle aunty with knee-pads) and the incident where that 'cute little beast' entered your room entertaining us for days! See you in Mumbai bro! 
love you lots,

Not many people know about it but you are a good poet as well. I have had opportunity to read your poems. I want you keep writing as each piece is a gem. I have grown a special connect with you over the period of time cz you were the first person I opened up about the insecurities. You are that easy going. People can share anything with utmost ease. You are like Donna (Suits) who knows the right thing to say at the right time. The guy with a great presence of mind. You inspired me to unleash the artist in me which led me to start sketching.

Damn I don't know what we weren't common about. From a marketing project group to Hell's Devils to whatever it is now (I don;t know what to call it), it was an awesome journey with you.

pgp31224,Ravi Gupta,RPG,,, I always wonder how can a person stay so quite. How do you manage to do that bro!!!. Appreciate the way you keep your room- I dont think i can keep my room so tidy in this life. Your timing on calling dibs would be always remembered. I always enjoyed working with you - especially at those last minutes/seconds. You were one of the person whom i would alwasy approach for any inputs- appreciate your patience and listening skills. Stay happy and all the very best for your future
pgp31224,Ravi Gupta,Silent,Witty,Cool," A wise man once said nothing! That's it. There was once a rumor that RPG only utters 4-5 words in a day. After sitting beside him for almost one year, I can vouch for the above rumor to be 100% true. Most of the time his eyes and an innocent smile do the talking. But this innocent and silent looking guy has a wild and mischievous side too. He is always one of the first persons in the group who understand sarcasm and witty jokes. His peculiar habit of keeping 20-30 tabs open in the browser always amazes me. Being an English tv series' lover, he is the official source to go to get newly downloaded episodes. Girls always like the silent person who speaks less and listens more. Same is the case with RPG. In the very first sem, one girl confessed that he was her 'inspiration' and crush. He was the one who in our first section party motivated me to taste 'something interesting'. ;) Good luck bro!                      "

It was really treat to have you in my friends' circle. Hell's Devils wouldn't be what it was without you and your snappy comments and shares. I shall not forget the SpEnt Quiz we won together.

pgp31224,Ravi Gupta,RPG,,,"He's almost the male version of me, with how less he talks and observes everything with a knowing smile on his face. Summer internship was fun thanks to you and Nikhil. Every time I saw your faces on our floor I couldn't stop laughing :P I still remember how you ditched Nikhil and left him to talk to Jaishree alone..Fun times :P"
pgp31225,Rishabh Agarwal,Amir,Intelligent,Marwadi," Ever-ready person of our group. whenever we plan to go out, he will never say no. He is also the tattoo-man (Dadi). He loves to play holi and most importantly, he is in love with Airtel connection. We are yet to decode a phrase that he always says"" I am single"". :D         "
pgp31225,Rishabh Agarwal,Kaminey,,," Consultant, shared lot of faltu stories with you, which are of no use. I have irritated you with the same stories, but I couldn't follow your advice anytime. Your bike has helped most of the guys at IIM L, including me, without which our group would have missed so many fun times in these 2 years. A small bit of advice, don't waste food in future. Hats off to your food ordering skills. I won't write anything more, because I feel ""shirish"" comes in to picture...:P Hope you get everything in future. Stay happy, work less enjoy more...:)    "
pgp31225,Rishabh Agarwal,Agarwal,,,"""Rish""- Thats what your loved ones say right:P. How can someone forget you love for southindian food- especially banglorean. The best among all in arguing- thank god we were not part of any GD panel!!. If there are two words to describe you, they would be ""Super intelligent"" and ""Super cool"". Thanks for arranging all those trips- wont have been possible without you. All the best for your future endeavors and keep in touch.

pgp31225,Rishabh Agarwal,Gluttony,Explorer,Reader,"You always give good vibes. He likes to keep low profile but he is a charismatic guy. The richest Aggarwal we have on campus :P along with a rich heart and beautiful thoughts. Although you are a fresher but there is always something or other thing to learn from you. Voracious reader he is, including Chetan Bhagat's novel :p An interesting person if you get a chance to talk to him and discover him. Cheers to you man!! ITC mein dhoom macha dena and mahine ka rashan bhijwa dena :p   "
pgp31225,Rishabh Agarwal,Poor,Intelligent,Book,"The only poor Agarwal of the India! Rishabh came to hell directly from Bit, so he was the only 'fresher' in our group. But don't let this fact fool you, in fact, he is one of the most successful students of our batch. From P&G in summers to ITC in finals, he consistently got the best profiles for a marketing enthusiast. His carefree and rebellious nature is in direct contrast with his superb academic records. He is one of the laziest person and a specialist in ordering food online or offline. I knew him from the first day of the college as we sat together on one bench. Being an avid book reader, he can easily be seen reading books on kindle in the lectures. This relationship with a certain 'Tambi' and his habit of keeping Shirish on his feet all the time gave me ample chances to make fun of him. Once he realizes that he has said something funny/wrong which can directly relate with Tambi, he will always seek silence as his last resort. His bike also deserves an honorable mention in this testimonial as he never hesitates to give the keys to anyone who need to go to the city. Being a mechanical graduate, he is still waiting to taste the softer side of the universe. May god grant him this opportunity very soon!                       "
pgp31225,Rishabh Agarwal,.,,,"Such analogies, much wow. That energy, that passion about food, spent more time discovering Lucknow cuisine than on campus. And still never set foot in Umang. There is no upper limit to the vivid imagination. Ibis - the funniest 2 days of internship.     "

You are one person who has impressed people only through your name amongst the juniors. ""Here's that guy, who beat pcommers who were pushed not once but twice"". From the ""Udte huwe lena"" aspect to your going crazy after a few drinks, you have given me a lot to look back to (no pun intended). Your ""Shirish"" moments shall always be remembered, which hasn't stopped though and I assume won't. What I shall always remember would be the party at Barking Deer in Mumbai. Goddamn..!! You sir, are destined for greatness. Just remember me when you reach there    "

Prior to that, she came across an overtly snobbish person who wouldn't even bother to say ""Hi"". But that perception was thankfully dismissed during our 2 months at Kuwait. I am thankful for that, because my second year wouldn't have been the same without her. A total foodie by heart she is, and we have loved exploring the city of Lucknow with further hopes to do the same in Bengaluru (because, of course, I am coming to visit you there!..:P) Oh, and how can I forget, she is a stickler for perfection, and so when it comes to projects, basically one can just chill because she is there to take EVERY single responsibility on her shoulders! And plus, we share this undying love for crafts and books, which has taken us to every possible craft and book stores in the city! I wouldn't say more, but here's wishing you all the very best in whatever you do! (And that includes a very important responsibility that I have already given you…Hush Hush!..:P)           "

Non-veg ka fan hai tu, you were someone who used to accompany me whenever I wanted to eat Bhejafry or any dish for that matter. Again had fun with our group and wishes for your future. I know you will live happily. Be the same.    "

I always wonder how can a person be so talented- musician, rapper, IITian, sportsman, startup, writing skills etc etc. Ohh bro!! you are one of the amazing multitalented person i have ever seen. I belive you would be a professional rapper soon and make great things. Thanks for waking me up for many quizzes, i dont know how many subject i would have failed without attending those. "

I appreciate him for his energy, writing and craziness. Cheers to the good times!! Best wishes!! "
pgp31228,Tushar Rokade,Creative,Calm,Rockstar,"Deep poetry, mystic symbolism, smiling face, calm & composed nature, good rapper and such a player- or in one word, Tushar. This Mumbaikar Nigga knows how to deal with various kind of people wisely & efficiently, something which I always wanted to learn from him. Being an avid book reader, you can talk to him on any topic under the sun and he will mesmerize you with his classic insights. His witty anecdotes, white-boards chronicles, and sarcastic remarks made the journey of hell funnier and brighter. His love for certain 'yeh gormint bik gyi hai' aunty is unparalleled. He is one of the very few people who really understand sarcasm very well and can be very nasty with his witty replies. Most of the times, after saying something dark or funny, we used to look at each other in order to appreciate and laugh at the dumbness of few people :P With his perfect uses of paradoxes and surreal symbolism, it feels like he has breathed life in the timeless characters of his poems. With his sense of humor and people winning skills, Nigga is bound to achieve heights in his life. May god keep you in good health and your life be as colorful and musical as it is now.                          "

Running out of words here, but since you came into Hell's Devils, it was a different thing altogether. Just got to say. Stay as you are broda', you are the real dope, don;t give a rat's a** to other.     "

You have a mother like caring attitude, a child like desire and never ending ambitions that set u apart. I loved to teach you. Every moment spent with you talking, studying, gyming(a very few), eating is memorable. My journey of Novartis also got excited because of you. Just wish that you get what you desire in your personal and professional life. Be as you are. Luv u..                                        "

A genuinely nice person, in the entire campus and of course a great cook, amazing dresser with a fabulous fashion sense, oh which reminds me, she rocked the fashion parade too. Extremely passionate about her profession – Novartis was just a tip of the iceberg. One should look at her mirror and the room decoration only to appreciate her sense of designing. Nice things will always come around to good people. You just have to believe in that.

We have actually done the thing where I don't say anything, but you know exactly what I am feeling and thinking. You are such a unique person, excessively sweet and caring, insanely eccentric and incredibly sexy. The class time, the food you have feed me, our gossips, our movie nights, our endless talks, your advise, our project time, study time, our selfies, trip to Udaipur Mount Abu, prom time, I missed you so much during internship and in France, your happy high, our campus walks.

pgp31231,SAUMYA SINGH,innocent-faced,fun,understanding," You make the definition of a must have friend during college time. I probably have had the most number of college trips with you! from north to south, we enjoyed every bit of it. Playing Table tennis, dance in spic macay and those endless case study competitions wouldn't have been fun without you. It is said, that good friends make fun of each other. We totally fit into this definition. I can never forget how we were perceived as ""tensed"" in various competitions and what exactly we were doing! You have been the official guide and 'maps' for our group. 'If two friends want, they can cross an ocean', your philosophies can be both funny and inspiring. Trying out the dresses in chandigarh, eating incessantly and finding the correct red shade has been the highlight of my stay at hell with you. talking to seniors, deciding our majors and even eating pulse in the library, dancing in the rain during camaraderie small stint at the gym and the karaoke night in Mumbai, probably this small space cannot fit in all the memories i share with you. It all started with the camaraderie play and i hope it doesn't end before a lifetime. keep smiling you innocent faced girl.cheers!  "

It is quite cool how sorted you are in your head about your likes, dislikes and your passions. If not for your unintentional quirkiness, first year would have been rather dull. By second year, unfortunately, you were already on your way to becoming mainstream. But I still see hope for redemption. I know just the right kind of person to help you :) I know you will only pursue what you are truly passionate about, and hence you will obviously be very good at it. So go ahead and rock on! "

You are undoubtedly the most interesting person I meet in IIML. Your A1 quality jokes, your unsocial behavior, your ""bhak saala"" and ""hai Kya"" and ""naraj"" all are something I am not going to forget. Class time, after parties, projects, ""the fall"", the chai time, internship time, our basketball sessions, your kidnapping of Sushi, your extra elaborate plans, the paintball time, the time you travelled an hour for my birthday at 12am, our movie plans together, there are countless times.

Last 2 years were a roller coaster of emotions which taught me how people from completely different backgrounds like us can come together and perform a task to near perfection if they believe and stand with each other as mentioned in the Three Musketeers film ""All for one and one for all"". I know our friendship ki picture abhi baaki hai mere dost.. looking forward to more pcom get together with you after HELL :)  "

pgp31233,Shreyak Gupta,Shreyuu,,," Mr. Consultant, PCommer, Footballer, Dancer :P. In short the all rounder of Delhi Group. Had awesome time with you during all the parties, outings, birthdays etc. etc. Wish you a lot of success in life. Macha diyo BCG me :)"
pgp31233,Shreyak Gupta,Dancer,,,"Shreyak,
I know you since the Mallay Ray days and have loved your company ever since. It has always been fun with you around and we have had so many memories together. All the dance sequences that we have performed right from 'dil cheez tuje' to 'kajrare'  to the parties at Mumbai, will always be remembered. I'm sure there are many more to come! 
Wish you all the success and happiness in life!
Love,
Kanika     "
pgp31233,Shreyak Gupta,Bro,Loving,Socho-socho," Shreyak, my bro. I think you realize the importance of the earphone rakhi I tied on your wrist on Raksha Bandhan Day. I have never in my life tied Rakhi to anyy friend before, and this says a lot about how strongly I feel about you. You are the person who can throw me in the air, jumble me up, shout at me, pull my cheeks till they are numb and ruffle my hair. And yet, you are the one who will embrace me in a big teddy bear style hug and tell me how crazy I am. You are the onlyy person who doesn't stop me from singing! Instead, you encourage me more and you sing along too. Hehe. Agar Tum Saaaaath Hoooo suna suna kar tu ne kaan paka diye the. You are so popular amongst girls - I am so proud of you! You are a complete softie - your heart just melts very easily - toughen up boyyy! You know when we met for the first time in Cyber Hub, I had thought it doesn't look like we will ever be more than acquaintances. Ah! How wrong was I. You are one of the most important people on campus for me. Hope you are alwayssss successful.   "
pgp31234,Shubham Vijay,Bro,,,"I've always found many similarities between us two. May be you are the better version of me. I wished I could have got more time to enjoy with you but what to do, your fan following doesn't leave you alone. P.S. I'm still better cricketer than you. "
pgp31234,Shubham Vijay,Chandler,,," You are the most amazing person that I have ever met. You know how to convince people and how to fulfill everyone's wish. Our friendship has taken a good time to evolve because I take a little time to be comfortable with guys and I regret this, otherwise we could have spent more time together. Nevertheless, the time that we spent together is memorable, whether it be watching aisha, your teaching, pani puri, stolen choco lava, bike rides during my fracture or your ppo party.You are the one person whom I can't say no and who had made me try a lot of different things that I have never done. Bas, ek advice hai ki throw your phone away because that to you anyway don't use. And my emotional atyachaar is mainly for you because I know you will fall prey to it.  I really liked the way you pointed my weakness and forced me to stand for elections. Its like lack of words to express my heart but just that, you are one of the best things that happened to me in campus. Shubham, I just wish that all your wishes come true and we remain friends forever.Luv u                                          "
pgp31234,Shubham Vijay,Hero,,,"When I first met you, you were so flamboyant that I had decided in my mind ""Yeh nahi ho paega"". But every new place I have been to, I have at least met one person who has completely belied my earlier impression of them, and here at IIM Lucknow, you are that person. You are an ""anokha"" (mark my improving Hindi) combination of crazy and calm - more crazy than calm - and for that I am glad. Your numerous guffaws in class (beaten only by the invincible Singhal) made section D such a joy ride. The subah 8 baje terrace ke upar wali beer, troubling the shit out of Mayus Meena, having you handle me after weed chai - the memories are numerous and special :) "
pgp31234,Shubham Vijay,Heroooo,,,"Thanks for teaching Economics in 1st year! You have much more clarity than the professor, or atleast it was evident in teaching. An advice: job ke saath thoda time invest karna in education sector, you will do great :) To good times!           "
pgp31234,Shubham Vijay,Muahhhh,,," Shubham Vijay; if there is one guy I am extremely comfortable with, it's you. I can share anything with you and I know it's going to be ok. You are there for everyone and it's hard to find people like that. Baby if only you were a little older, definitely would have successfully seduced you :P I don't need to say what you mean to me, I know you know &#61514; "
pgp31234,Shubham Vijay,Pakhandi,,,"You were the first friend I had at this campus and I will remember all the fun things we did - the endless table tennis bouts, climbing up to H17's roof, the truth-or-dare when we had to deal with the crazy 2nd year girl, 101 ways to irritate people and so on. It was great while it lasted. Good luck for your career and all your future endeavors!      "
pgp31234,Shubham Vijay,Bum,Suuuuubam,Hero,"Suuuuubam, how do you manage to be so loved by people I have no idea, people fell in love with you so easily. The same happened to me too. Our first conversation of 15 mins and I was in love. You have been inflicted with maximum of my slaps, and abuses and angry flashes and mood swings. However may you irritate me, I love you so so much. Sirf ussi ko tu gussa karte ho jisse tum pyar karte ho, toh samajh jao kitna pyar karti hun tumse. And I will be willing to do anything for you at any point of my life. The best memory of us is actually the balcony party, it was such an epic beautiful night. Cheers to the numerous days and nights we have spent. Lastly, I will be there for you baby, Always.
           "
pgp31234,Shubham Vijay,Bhai,,,"The most helpful person I've met. Boy, you stood by everybody who needed you. Somehow, I feel you are a wiser and younger brother to me. You are sensible beyond imagination. Keep shining boy!    "

pgp31234,Shubham Vijay,Dependable,Happy,,"The first memory of you I have is the conversation I overheard walking behind you. Hilarious it was! Over the time as I have gotten to know you better, I have realized how nice a friend you are. The times you have stood up for and helped people out shall be remembered by not just those people but many others who were witness to those. Your friends are indeed lucky to have you in their lives. Wherever you go ahead from here, I hope life stays kind to and that you achieve all your hearts' desires. Take care of yourself buddy. Good luck and so long!   "

PPS: I will never forget the disgusting elephant shower though    "

'kitna ganda PJ tha yaar' was her pet line for all my jokes. But still, she laughed at all of those jokes. She likes to get clicked and you can found in the front row of every group pic very easily. My ears are still ringing with her shrill voice when she was rooting for Ranvijay during some MV event. She almost fainted when she finally managed a pic with him. But this is only one side of this bubbly girl, she is very studious and got a good placement offer in the end. Gud luck for your future!                         "

It was great being friends and study partners back in term 1, and project partners in so many others. Best of luck for the future. "
pgp31236,Soumya Gupta,SG,,,"SG you are one of the few people on campus who were my family away from home! The countless hours spent in Panel Room 2, discussing single topic for hours, creating a consensus at 4 AM when most of the college is fast asleep and running summers and finals process were some of the most cherished memories I had on campus with you. Last 2 years were a roller coaster of emotions which taught me how people from completely different backgrounds like us can come together and perform a task to near perfection if they believe and stand with each other as mentioned in the Three Musketeers film ""All for one and one for all"". I know our friendship ki picture abhi baaki hai mere dost.. looking forward to more pcom get together with you after HELL :)  "

pgp31236,Soumya Gupta,.,,,"Soumya, you have been a great friend and neighbour. We wasted a lot of time in the first year by not being friends. Discussing random stuff with you was always so much fun. You are very sweet in all respects. You are the kind of person I would wish to remain friends with all my life. So, you better stay in touch! :)        "

I think being from the similar backgrounds, we both got similar culture shocks in the college, and we learnt to deal with them. You are an extremely determined person - something that resonates with me a lot. You are bold and strong minded. I like how you don't give a fuck to any peer pressure that comes your way. Stay like this forever. I am sure you are gonna rock at HUL!  "

pgp31237,Souvik Ghosh,Guruji,,,"There are very few people who can be impersonal, dedicated, smart, hardworking, selfless, and on top of these good friends. Since the first IIC task of making posters on Photoshop to today, you remain my go-to guy on campus for everything. The silent guruji (though at the time of writing this I don't know why the name) is a big time party-monger. You work, you party, you do all sorts of public service on campus (Synapse se leke Controls), and you still do great with your acads and your hobbies. Your Capgemini news was one of the best moments of my days on campus. Not many will learn of what you do and how you do it, but that's what Guruji (a.k.a. Hell ka Batman) stands for. That's what you are, a great person :) "

pgp31237,Souvik Ghosh,Nerd,Gentleman,Sloth,"Our journey started with being classmates in Sec D to the best of friends in 2nd year. We have nothing in common. He is finance guy, I am a marketing person. He is a nerd, studious and do assignments. I am allergic to studies and never completed any assignment: p Yes, we do have IT connection but then he is geek in that too. He is the man of titles. Synapse, Controls, Quizzing commoners, Nihilanth, T-shirt designer, Bong committee, North east committee and other several non-formal groups are always associated with him. The oxymoron here is that he is a biggest procrastinator if he is not partying or working with his associated titles. He doesn't give fucks to non-sense and gives all when it comes to friendship. He has been there in all my MBA journey. I give credit to him for all the good things working out for me in the end. He is a bong but he is in North East group. He is all geeky nd nerdy but he is humblest of all. He is an inspiration for lovers. A person for whom experiences matters more than the CV points. Cheers to you man!! I have learnt a lot from you!      "

I was surprised initially looking at your curiosity to dig through all the team's stuff (Portals :P), wish I had at least a small % of it in me :D. You are such a level-headed person. Made us realise that we can always count on you no matter come what may (in a positive sense)          "
pgp31237,Souvik Ghosh,Honest,Good,Intelligent,"We share many hobbies & interests- Harry potter, photography, designing, mythology, and comics. But that's not the only thing which makes you one of my best friends ever. I've really never met any guy as witty, creative, dedicated, hardworking yet so calm and simple as you are. I remember once we were talking outside the mess about harry potter and stuff around 3 in the morning and we talked for hours. Man! Being a true Bengali at heart, his love for good non-veg food, books and reading about anything under the sun was not a surprise for me. He calls himself the black sheep of his family, but believe me when I say that I've never seen black being so colorful before. Your answer during post-summers celebration about 'special hug' melted the hearts of many girls, yet you were thinking about the only one all the time. I never felt bored talking to you and sometimes your calmness kept me sane in the hell. It's strange in two years, we never went on any trip together. I still felt that you shouldn't have missed many parties and outings with us but again your work ethics and dedication comes first. 1250 characters are very less to express, but let me summarize this in one phrase.

Her madness just meets mine :p From crazy scenes of section party to the most un-sophisticated in-house parties, we have done all. She laughs hard to make everyone uncomfortable. She loves like a true friend. We had roller coaster times in our friendship but to sum it all, we never found anyone worth sharing our moments other than us. No one can resist loving her just after a meeting that's the vibe she give. A happy-go-lucky Punjabi Panda she is.
Supreet <3 
You can't say she is elegant but she is a beauty with brains  
Her hysterical laughter like ""Janice"" is famous in friends 
There is only one thing that is wrong with her
She forgets what is her worth
Guys say ""her eyes are lonely and strand of her hair kills""
That is because she always looks for the things that she can feel 
She wears strength and darkness equally well
The girl has always been half goddess, half hell
Her being is in her being unapologetically herself
Comfortable in her perfect imperfection
  Love you a loads!! Muahh :*     "

We were always in on-off kind of friendship, but I still remember your first birthday party, when I made you watch 'Gunda'. Haha And panda's after-party reactions when you were calling UFO's and asking aliens to come down in convocation ground. This Punjabi kudi can be really wild in the parties. But when it comes to studying, she doesn't like second standards. She is kind of lazy but not when it comes to quizzes or exams. Your novel reading list and song selection were awesome. In MV last year, finally your lonely soul found some solace, your wanderlust found a source of a lifetime of adventures. Though that pencil sketch could be a little better (lol). You golu-molu kudi were the official entry of our group for world's cutest panda. Though we've wasted a lot of time in futile things but I wish we could've spent more time together and enjoyed a little more. Like Souvik, you were also very busy because of that we couldn't go for any trip together. But I am really happy for your happiness. I hope you'll get everything in life, which you deserves.

pgp31240,surbhi singhal,Loud,Louder,Loudest," Let me give you a break from all the sarcasm and be nice to you for a change. Notwithstanding the fact that you took us to the French embassy for our visas and almost got us shot for tresspassing, my most memorable moment with you would actually be when we sat till the wee hours of the morning, on the bench near Amul, discussing all things under the sun (quite literally). And our euro trip merits a book of its own. Your ""mince no words"" attitude is a refreshing change from boring diplomacy, so continue to be that way. You go girl! "
pgp31240,surbhi singhal,Baby,,," Baby.. I so love you. You actually were like my daughter here :P and I loved pampering you. It is always so good to have you around. You can actually make anyone comfortable and honestly you are one of the most genuine people I have met here. Stay that way. We have lots of shopping trips and crazy fun to look forward to. Whatever I write won't do justice to what you mean to me. Just know I will always always be there for you. Love you loads!

 "
pgp31240,surbhi singhal,Aur?,,,"As I look back at the last two years - at you trying to overcome my thick-headed nature and getting me to participate in group/section activities, our back-and-forth interactions consisting only of ""Aur?"", your (vain) attempts at getting me to smile while taking selfies, being surprised how quickly you learned basketball, being horrified when you showed me that 50 shades movie and then taking my (sweet) revenge by kidnapping Sushi, the card and mafia games that you organized, and your moral support during the finals - as I look back at all that, I realize how lucky I am to have you as a friend. And when I say friend, I mean not an acquaintance, but a person who has been as fun to talk to by the end of the 2nd year as she was at the start of the 1st year, and a person who is still as good-natured as she was since I first knew her. I believe that no matter how large one's group is, there's only a handful of them whom one cherishes and remembers, and in my case, you're one of those people. I hope you continue to stay in touch, and I wish you a successful career and a great life ahead. (Great at the art of flattery, aren't I?)  "

pgp31240,surbhi singhal,TypicalDelhiGirl,SelfieQueen,MutualBBTFan,"Typical Delhi Girl. Damn. I'll not forget that easily. The one defining moment of the whole induction. Also because I was made to stand on the board and write down the characteristics as you spoke them. You have been one powerhouse I have seen, always high on energy and enthusiasm and at the same time, smart ( and pretty, not to forget). Being a part of Horrible Bosses with you was a great great experience. The party at Secret Barn, the Section Parties, Camaraderie fashion show and all the randomness in Section -D. Those were the days. Those were really great times and memories that I shall forever cherish. All those sh*t talks in library, about anything and everyting in the pretext of doing projects, or preparing for exams or quizzes were hilarious and you have been a constant partner in crime in the first term, a reason I had a great time back then. It was great being friends, and wish you all the best for future. As Sheldon would say, ""May the force be with you"""
pgp31240,surbhi singhal,Partner-in-crime,,,"The whakiest person I have met here. Be it late night campus walks, having 'happydent' in bodhigrih or climbing on the water tank, sitting in the middle of the street playing spin-the-bottle you are up for everything. You with your liveliness and carefree swag induce the free-spirit in all around you. You are such a bundle of joy to me and I guess that's why I relate to you so much. "
pgp31240,surbhi singhal,partyfreak,,," The Horrible Bosses, Camaraderie and section parties helped to know you better. It is always fun working/talking with you. Your dedication and commitment towards work are unparalleled. Without your help, I don't think we could have performed camaraderie that well. All the best singhal                     "

Among the closest of my friends on campus and one of the sweetest people I have met! Words fail me here but definitely miss you post IIM L! We have so many memories together that I feel blessed because of them. One of the best trips of my life happened because you agreed to come along. You made that trip a happy, cherished memory, as you made most of the time we spent together. I wish you loads of love and all the best in the life ahead Singhal. Take good care of yourself. Stay warm, charming and happy-go-lucky as you are, always. Stay blessed, amigo.                                           "

You might be blunt, so much that I have seen professors on the verge of tears after they encounter you. But inside, you are a sweetheart! You care for others, do things in ways that win hearts. And the amount of fun I have had with you, be it in movies parties or studies, is unmatchable. And who knew this place of rat-race could give me a sister?! PS: Lots more fun in Mumbai awaited!   "
pgp31240 ,surbhi singhal,Hot,Sweet,,One of the most humble people that I met. Plus one of the hottest girls on campus. Crazy and fun at the same time. Beauty with brains.

I may not say this often but I value your friendship a lot. All the best for future.         
pgp31241,Suvankar Mondal,Dada,Mama,Chacha," Famous in the campus for his Herbal tea, he has got a tea for every situation be it sad or happy. Fastest in eating & never ending hunger, when you go to a restaurant & sit beside Dada make sure you've got something to eat in your room. Only person who has experienced the highest level of maslaw's hierarchy. If you don't find him in his room, Most certain you'll find him on Himalayas. But he is an awesome person from inside although he'll never work in the group but he'll always take responsibility for your deeds."

pgp31241,Suvankar Mondal,Dada,,,"Dada is the reason poultry business is thriving in Lucknow. IIM Lucknow has everything in abundance, so you can expect to find quite a few extermely talented people but you will be hard pressed to find someone who is more artistic and humble than Suvankar Dada. His portraits have brought some much needed glamour in the otherwise boring corridors of Hostel 13. Dada is the most connected guy on the campus. This food lover, tea maker and traveler friend of mine is the reason behind some of the most cherished memories of Hell. You are one the few guys on campus with whom I would definitely like to stay in touch :)    "
pgp31241,Suvankar Mondal,Dada,,," Dada, you are the chilliest person I have ever met. Aise hi carefree rehna.Your dance was just out of the world. Keep smiling. Stay in touch  "
pgp31241,Suvankar Mondal,Dada,Warm,Conversationist,"Dada, we didn't get much time together but In this short span of time I've grown very fond of you. It's so nice to have someone who understand your mood, your stressed face. I love how we shared so much over short breaks. Dada I'll miss you. Hope to wine & dine at fancy places with great food with you soon and again and again. Lots of love <3  "
pgp31241,Suvankar Mondal,WeedBaba,,," You are the coolest man on all of campus and there is absolutely no denying that. The only time I have seen you remotely agitated was when you were refused fish curry and when you had to prove bong supremacy. Our fuck all, abstract conversations can make anybody go mad. I distinctly remember this campus walk we took on a very beautiful evening, where I got to know a little more about your passion for achitecture and your cool, long term plans. And of course, thank you for giving me my first anxiety attack and scaring the living day lights out of me. I shall NEVER forget your ***d chai. "
pgp31241,Suvankar Mondal,Dada,,, Dada!!! You are one hell of an interesting character and there is a lot I got to learn from you. I really appreciate the way you deal with people and you actually don't judge. No doubt it's easy to talk to you. Stay this way and keep on having fun! And you do know your moves :p Peace hai bro :P 
pgp31241,Suvankar Mondal,Dada,Lord,Peace," Dada, it was not a coincidence when our roll numbers were together, it was destiny. You are that one person that surely leaves a smile on my face everytime I meet you. You are like the perfect combination of cool, cute and handsome. We have had unlimited amount of chai, our section parties, the terrace in the rain, our selfies, long nights, love for food, the Tundey kebab, the kulfi, the Chewing Gum, the philosophical talks. I will miss you Dada a lot. Lastly bas kahungi ""Arrre baba, peace hai"".            "
pgp31241,Suvankar Mondal,Dada,,, Dada... You've been an amazing neighbour in classes throughout the first year...we had so much fun laughing on stupid jokes and doing DCP from last bench... #backbenchers #SectionD

pgp31241,Suvankar Mondal,Dada,,," Dada! Few know that he was christened 'Dada' by me. In his ponchos and harem pants, that would give any damsel a run for her money, he, by far remains one of the most chilled out people in the campus. Treats everyone with his stories coupled with his special branded 'Chai'   "
pgp31241 ,Suvankar Mondal,Dada,Stories,Food," You want to drink tea, Dada is the go to person. Sometimes has a unique (read awful) taste in music. Has the tendency to pester and annoy people (ekdum dass leta hai) and if you point out, he'll say -  ""bhai XX days reh gye hai sath me, Convo ke baad royega tu issi ke liye"". Dada is definitely a very good company to have. Is very innovative in many things from cooking and eating to his endless stories. One should beware of him on the dinner table. "
pgp31241 ,Suvankar Mondal,Dada,,,Dada is awesome. He has crazy interests which match with mine :D I wish I would have met you earlier. Bohot mazze karte. Looking forward to out Thailand trip :)           
pgp31242,Ameya Thakur,Cool,Charming,Confident,"Ameya- one of the many names of lord Ganesha. And as per the attribute of Ganesha, he was with me at every moment whether low or high. I really appreciated advises given by you and I wish we could have completed our chat on that particular day. His cool nature in even difficult situation and ability to make us laugh with subtle comments are the things, I appreciate. He is very good at performing many responsibilities at the same time and he always delivers his best in each of them. When most of us were having night-outs in our first two terms, Ameya used to sleep before midnight every day and still he was able to perform well in all aspects whether it is summer internship selection process or academics or working as an alumni committee member. Though he calls himself an introvert but I think he is only one among our group of close friends, who has good amount of interaction with many students across 3 batches (pgp330, pgp31 and pgp32). Personally, I consider him as my role model. I am really lucky to find a friend like you. All the best.      "
pgp31242,Ameya Thakur,My-GoTo-Man,,,"From the GDs at ACC to the balcony bonfires at IIM L, we've shared a long journey together. I remember the early days at HelL, when this baffled fresher looked up to the calm and composed Thakur for help and guidance. You may not even know, but I've learned a lot from just observing you. In these two years, you've been my go-to guy during all my tough times. We've had a lot of fun along the way too! The endless night walks, the cricket @ titanic, exploring Lucknow city together, the trips to Manali and Rishikesh, the Diwali celebrations, the crazy dancing to 'Malhari', family dinners in the wing, the nicknames you gave everyone (but didn't get one yourself, our bad), the name game ppt,,,,, all of it will always be deeply cherished. Our journey isn't ending here, we're just crossing another milestone. An early one at that. Miles to go still… So, see you after HelL bro!           "

pgp31242,Ameya Thakur,Thakur,,,Summer Internship was a great learning experience for me- not just in office but outside too. Aprreciate your patience and discipline- something i learnt from you. You were always there guiding and giving gyaan on all aspects. Have a great future and keep in touch 
pgp31242,Ameya Thakur,Mumbaikar,Mischievous,Intelligent,"""Alibaugh se hai kya!"" Yup, bro. However, he is different from the image of alibaugh people, which we usually see in the movies. I always find him interesting with his calculated behavior, deep thinking, and love for puns. If the joke, sarcasm, the pun is good, Thakur will appear from thin air and appreciate it. This Mumbaikar really loves to play cricket and was a regular in our basketball ground cricket sessions. However, he will always start from a wide delivery. :P His mischievous smiling look made many girls lost their heart in the hell. In addition, somehow his fb pics always marveled me with the composition and deep poetic appeal of those. Thakur, you will rock buddy. Be happy and spread many laughs. Good luck!                         "

pgp31242,Ameya Thakur,ForeverBlues,,,"This I am frankly a little confused what to write. I remember you being a last minute addition to the Marketing group who ended up doing the lion's share of the job. That is how it started and I was like, ""Dude, this is the guy"" And then came the cherry on top, Chelsea fan.I dunno, but I guess you are the second biggest Chelsea fan I have ever met. Not only Chelsea, our discussions from football to movies to music (you taste in music is phenomenal) to even intellectual ones were really refreshing. The Controls-Systems rivalry, always kept apart and discussions were intense in many cases. It was great having a friend and a co-Chelsea fan like you. And your dedication and intellect was pretty inspiring    "
pgp31242,Ameya Thakur,Thakur,,,"The calm, composed dude with full swag! My next-seat neighbor. How comfortable I was sitting with you in the last bench. And dude, our love for non veg! Dude, if not anything, I'll keep meeting you only to visit eateries together. Cheers brother!    "

pgp31242,Ameya Thakur,Straight-forward,Confident,,"I remember the numerous times you would taunt me when I used to come to mess first floor for ordering Egg-fry.

pgp31243,Udit Gera,.,,,"Geraaaa...One friend that I made because of Section D. That too, because of a group project. Our bonding strengthened very soon, even though we had a completely different set of friends. Remember, our group study sessions together and also the ones a night before the exam? More so, remember that day in the first year when you came to my room, and we talked for hours, discussing random stuff. It was always so easy to share things with you, Gere. Although, you used to tease me on them later, still I used to have that immense urge to share. Who knew that this fun bindaas guy could also give advice on serious stuff? :P  You were one of my best friends here on campus, and I hope that we remain the same for the years to come.            "
pgp31243,Udit Gera,NaradMuni,,,"You are one of the laziest and smartest friends I have. I think our friendship began with dancing together in section parties, strengthened over time due to the innumerable group projects and study sessions, and peaked while Ashish and I constantly bickered. From stalking people on Facebook to trying to match our interests (Hint: my spoken poetry and your lame YouTube videos) to latest addition being campus runs – we have shared so many memories. Thanks for being there bro!    "
pgp31243,Udit Gera,Quick Witted,,,"You are one person who has so many funny stories to tell, who is always ready to gossip :P and the little dance that you do when you think that no one is watching is hilarious.

pgp31243,Udit Gera,RespectThe,,,"I guess you were amongst the first friends I made here (remember Horrible Bosses?) In a time when I used to sit at lunch alone, it was you and Vinay who became my first sections friends. First term was a dream run for us, be it projects (pretty sure all the projects we were together), the studies and preparation in the library which was our second home, your long hours on the phone, the constant attempt to click those sleeping pictures of mine and posting on the group and the train back to Delhi. Secret Barn was an awesome experience. It was an awesome friendship and one that I shall always cherish. P.S. Lose that potbelly bro.    "
pgp31243,Udit Gera,Bhai,,,"When I first saw you in the class, I was relieved. Finally, someone joined me on the last bench. You're the only one with whom I can freely share anything and everything. ITC prep in the batch meet, group studies in the library, random classroom discussions, horrible bosses party and so on left me with a lot of memories to cherish.

The way he understands quickly and helps people are few of his many appreciable qualities. He has been our CR for the whole first year, which helped us in relieving the pressure of the extensive curriculum of mba. He always acted for the greater good, fought for classmates and was very sincere in his approaches. He was also very instrumental in all section parties and various birthday celebrations we had in first year. I will always remember his funny south Indian dance moves in parties at my room. Because of his coolness, his dance moves and speaking skills, he was heartthrob of many girls in the campus. However, he himself was smitten and completely bowled over by Mami. YOU are destined to do something very good in your life, my friend. Good luck!                         "

You have been an inspiring CR and most of all a really great friend. Our Mama, and it was great having you in each and every part of my two years here.

pgp31249,Sandeep Ambati,Gymson,,,"Our parties become alive because of you bro, and the stuff you do gives us a lot of memories. You have a high infectious energy, and your commitment is unparalleled (not missing the gym like gymson :P).

pgp31249,Sandeep Ambati,Sweet,smiley,,You are the sweetest person I know on campus who is always ready for help and cares for his friends. We have always been more of smiley friends who chit chat on our way to mess. Will miss those smiles. Hope to be friends forever. Keep in touch and all the best for your future :) (P.S you have to show me Hyderabad soon )            
pgp31249,Sandeep Ambati,SeniorManager,Sincere,,"You were my first friend at IIML and was always envious of your English accent :P. Seen you transform from someone hesitant to sit in your assigned place to a Gymson and Senior Manager :P You were also a great partner in projects, never giving haath #Controller #IAC #ICICI            "
pgp31250,Ankita Gupta,Amazonian,life,Brilliant,"I really admire this girl- the real 'Amazonian' like wonder woman. The level of dedication she shows in everything be it class assignments or OIG work is really commendable.  Both OIG seniors and juniors knew that they can rely on her and always contacted her in the case of doubts. She fought hard for amazon in summer's process and in the end got two PPO's from Amazon. ;) But this is only one side of her, she is real fun to be with. In all OIG parties, we saw her wildness and break-dancer skills. She loves music and dance and always urged everybody to join her on the dance floor. Though in the end, she is always the first one to hit the floor, in the literal sense. :D Most of her second year went in jumbling in two cities in order to complete her dual-MBA degree from other nearby IIM. Most of us thought, maybe she had opted for the domestic stex program. I wish you to get the official degree for your dual-MBA very soon. She always asked me for chocolates, toffees or anything to eat during the common lectures. But never brought anything for me from Kota or from the numerous places she visited in the second year. Jokes apart, you deserves everything you've achieved so far. I know you will rock always.                         "
pgp31250,Ankita Gupta,Talented,Intelligent,caring,"She is a perfectionist with attention to detail. She cannot tolerate sub-par work and can scold anyone for this. She scolded me a hundred times. Initially, I didn't use to like it but then eventually I saw an improvement in my work and realized that all her yelling was for my greater good. She dedicates all her energy to make things work which makes her worthy of everything whether it be work or friends or anything in this world. Spending 2 years with her had been a delight and amazing.  "
pgp31250,Ankita Gupta,Shrewd,,,"Ankita is a person who is true Amazonian at her heart. She had imbibed their tagline of 'Work hard and party harder'. She can be seen at almost all parties having fun as well as she can be seen having night-out at the library working for a shitty IPL match scheduling problem ;). You teach me how one can balance both personal and professional life and excel in both of them. I am so envy of your achievements at campus- Goof CGPA, Head to toe, good job and couple of more things which can't be discussed here ;). I am happy for you and I am confident that you will keep on shine in future.  "
pgp31250,Ankita Gupta,Ankita,,, Here work ex is counted as negative point but hardly anyone will be able to say that in your case. The number of things that you have always amazed me.       
pgp31250,Ankita Gupta,FriendForeever,Irreplacable,,"I could never be more thankful for having you in my life. There is actually only a small percentage of friends that become a permanent part of one's life and I know, you are one of them. What I love about you is that I can literally share any damn thing with you. I feel a strong connection even though we don't meet frequently or talk regularly. It is always easy to reconnect when we see or talk to each other. I wish this bond stays like this forever and ever. Love You ! God Bless!                 "
pgp31250 ,Ankita Gupta,Sorted,Fun,,You are one of the balanced people in our campus. Crazy in parties and serious when you need to be. OIG ka chota packet bada dhamaka. Stay the same. Will continue to party in Amazon :)

pgp31251,ANKUR AGARWAL,GoGetter,,,"SIGFi was an important part of this two years journey at IIML. I couldn't have asked for a better SIGFi 31. Committee work never seemed a pain with you. I thoroughly enjoyed the times we spent together, being there for one another beyond committee, to say the least. The bonding and the understanding with you will last for life (much much credits to be given to you for this). For all the times we spent together, parties, placement preps, quizzes, dealing with juniors and seniors, not dealing with them :P, goof ups.... all these shall always be cherished. Looking forward to a friendship for years and beyond :)      "
pgp31251,ANKUR AGARWAL,Cute,,," We met late and I know u regret it because shubham got the first mover advantage:-p.. I guess we met the first time at your room during my elections and from there, our friendship evolved. You were the one who made my placement preparation easy and interesting. You were always there to listen to my inhibitions and kept motivating me. There are uncountable cherishable moments spent with you- our breakfasts, walk to shubham's room amidst dogs, case preparations, long campus walks, late night teas, drinking, salsa dance, prom, stolen choco lava, safolla masala oats acting, baby doll dance, repeat mode conversations, khosla ka ghosla completed in like 4-5 takes and many more. Your gut feeling is something I started trusting and it was true also. Your connections are amazing; I also need training in that aspect. You are the one I like spending time with and so, a regret from my side too that we met late. Be as you are, available for everyone at every time. Sorry for troubling you after getting drunk.I have a lot more to say but can't find words. Just that I luv u, keep smiling, stay in touch.                                       "
pgp31251,ANKUR AGARWAL,Golu,,," Meeting you was an absolute joy, and it is rather unfortunate, that it only happened towards the fag end of our MBA journey. You are an unassuming, simpleton who exudes a lot of warmth. Not many people can put me at ease in the first meeting but you were one of those rare exceptions. And the journey only got more awesome ever since. You have your head in the right place and this virtue will take places. Hopefully, by the time you read this message, I would have already seen you groove to baby doll. :P  "
pgp31251,ANKUR AGARWAL,Sweet,,, You are probably one of the last persons I became friends with and yet how easily we became such good friends. It was quite effortless( And this is a big compliment :P)  You are a really caring person and it's very easy being around you.  Again like you am not really good at this stuff and am quite sure you know what I will say anyway. Love you baby &#61514;

pgp31251,ANKUR AGARWAL,Ankuuu,,,"Ankuuuu. Idiot you wasted an entire year. Rather I wasted an entire year before we could become the Pepsi and the movie ticket.

pgp31251 ,ANKUR AGARWAL,Perfect,Fun,,It was a pleasure knowing you dude. One of the most fun people I have met. I only got to know you better after the intern but we became such good friends so fast.

pgp31253,Archna Singh,Cute,Feminist,Jolly," Hey Archi! You are a cute looking 'aunty' that rejected me as a 'bachha' when you came to know my age. :p I have enjoyed all the feminist drama that you do (and threaten to teach Divya). Also, pulling your nose once a while just to have your reaction has been fun!!

What struck me the most towards the end of our time at HELL was that your jolly nature even withstood the pressures of  placement as you maintained your composure. I really appreciate this quality. It will keep your happy.

Wish you all the best in life Archi. May you do exceedingly well!!  "

Keep smiling!      
pgp31253,Archna Singh,bold,infectious,vivacious,"It was in the first section party that i heard a lively laugh and when i turned around i came face to face with the phenomenon called ""Archna Singh"". She is one of those happy go lucky people around whom parties revolve. Arguably the best dancer of the section who needs nothing more than mere beats falling on her ears to get her feet moving. She is not one who would dab her fingers into anything, but when she picks something she means business. One of the rare species i know who love dark chocolate. A very hard headed lass who is really great company to hangout with. I have not had many a conversations with her but in the rare ocassions i do she has the power to paint animated vivid mental pictures of whatever she intends to convey. Stay the way you are and keep smiling          "

pgp31254,Arindam Chowdhury,Confident,Mature,Cool,"My first lobby friend at HeLL!! I like the confidence, knowledge and attention to detail you have in various fields. You don't hesitate to put your points forward irrespective of the conditions and that is something that can be learned from you. I really liked the discussions we have had over various topics and there were hardly any moments that we were on the same side of coin (at least I don't remember any), and personally I learned a lot from those especially during our HEPP preparations. 
I enjoyed all our outings, especially to non veg places and was really lucky to find someone whose craving for non veg is like me!! I never admitted this to you, I found out that, you are someone who would do anything for his friends without thinking of wrong and right. There is this one thing, that I have never won a bet against you, we meet some time and I will square it off. I will look forward to meet you and eat non veg like there is no tomorrow. Yo !!

pgp31254,Arindam Chowdhury,Logical,ambitious,Supportive,He believes in saying things which logically makes sense after analyzing the situation. He is bold and firm in his decisions since he believes in himself. He listens to people first and then makes his point. He avoids shallow learning and prefer to dig deep into the concepts and then tries to understand the given concept.

Having birthdays side by side, the TCS Chennai stuff, all competitions, wins-loses, our trips, those fights, my grammatical errors, those leg pullings, superheated arguments, support when required and much more. Thank you for being there and being such an amazing person as you are. Our friendship will always be special for me and the moments with you are too dear.

Trust me no one has irritated me as much as you have (one more gold medal to you).  
I might have said that you are not helpful and self-centric person which you are.. see I don't lie unnecessarily. Even after so many negatives, you are still a gem as a friend (I am still searching for positive). 
On a serious note, you were always there as a friend for me in times of need.

It was second year where we became friends who shared all the life's shit and made fun of it. The most memorable part will always be the Theka Desi Sharab and Shahrukh Khan. You are an amazing person who is good at heart and respects people for who they are. Just stay the way you are. And needless to say, we are going to be in touch forever :)                 "

You are the best thing that has happened to me and your passion for pursuing your goal is inspiring. You have always supported me and that helped me get through many tough times.

Lol, ek toh IIC se nikalwaya, aur phir Gallen jake na padhai ki na Ghumi. But then, you are the stud of IIC. You don't talk much, you don't interfere much, but you know when to work, and how to work. I would have loved to know you more as a friend and a person, and I think life still has ample time. To the great talks yet to be had over some delightful food and music! Amen! "
pgp31266,Jasneet Kaur,Amazinglywierd,Ambitious,Sleepyhead," A person who can sleep almost all the time and still sleepy. You are my source for all the happenings in the college…Gossip girl :D
You are the weirdest person I have ever met. You are crazy for only one thing – STUDY. I always wonder from where this madness before any exam or quiz comes from. I am thankful to you to help me forget about my bad performance in exam by your Rona dhona almost after every exam. Although results were always opposite. 
I studied till 5 AM just because of you and this time seriously thankful to you for that. I am not good at expressing my feelings especially in writing. I hope you know how special your friendship is to me when I keep my phone down to first listen to you (I deserve medal for listening to your unrealistic logics and stupid theories). I spent a considerable part of IIM life with you, studying together for exams, getting fat together, dubsmash ('prem rattan dhan payo') , campus walks and so many memorable moments...
I have picked up on your habits like listening to songs while studying and sometimes not to worrying about my messy room. I hope you have learnt something from me (duniyagiri wala gyan).
Your friendship is a gift to me that I will cherish forever. Love you <3

pgp31266,Jasneet Kaur,Jotu,,,"Always be happy and keep on laughing on every little thing, the way you do now. Your innate desire to help others is truly desirable. Just keep swinging your hairs in the inimitable way that you do and we will keep making fun of that.              "

pgp31267,Hemalatha  Kanneganti,Bold,No-nonsense,Sweet,"Hema is among the most bindaas and badass people on camppus. She's someone who would follow her passion even if it meant choosing an unconventional path. She is bold and unafraid to jump into a new situation head-first. She's one of the most self-driven, curious and exploratory people. But she has another side too. She's a caring and supportive friend. She's playful and fun. I've seen her deal with highs and lows. She's been vulnerable and then pulled herself right back up. Overall I just want to say that whatever you do, I know you'll be true to yourself and to what you want :). I love you :*               "

We have had endless discussions for umpteen hours solving many case studies. You are the only person in my life who buys lives in games using real money (remember Pokemon Go) :P. I admire your way of thinking about ""What you want from life"" and the way you make your hands dirty with your entrepreneurial spirit.

Just don't spill any more drinks on my blanket. Kthanks. You resemble the free spirit that I'd like to be. To live without a care in the world (almost) is awe-inspiring.

pgp31269,Kavya  Bhargava,Passion,Order,Food,"I have never met a person as focused on what she wants and on her goals than Kavya. When she gets going, nothing can stop her. Don't get me wrong though, this girl stretches the limits of laziness too. She can stay in bed for two days straight, moving only to attend the most basic of necessities and at the same time she will attack a project or case study with the keen eye of a hunter, not resting till the prey is caught. One time she slept through a day and a half and was still tired the night of the second day, going right to sleep like she hadn't slept in ages. She is also my proxy mom, always telling me to clean my room, to be on time and to dress right. The one thing I absolutely adore about Kavya is the passion with which she loves those close to her. There is no in-between, there is no restraint. I am fortunate to have known that and to have had her by my side in this journey through Hell.            "

You are truly an amazing friend that I have!! You are very humorous and have inexplicable presence of mind. If there is one thing that I want to learn from you that would be punctuality.  
We have shared so many things together and I guess we became very good friend very early.  You are the one with which I have spent both quantity and quality of my time here in IIML. Believe it or not I have learned a lot from you by telling you things. You are among one of my friends where I won't hesitate to share anything.

For all the times we spent together, parties, placement preps, quizzes, dealing with juniors and seniors, not dealing with them :P, goof ups (and so much of this on Skype and Whatsapp with you).. all these shall always be cherished. We also won laurels with your Machau aashirwaad. I truly enjoyed all discussions with you, work, studies, finbytes, etc. Stay this Machau self always and keep blessing people; you will reach greater heights! Looking forward to a friendship for years and beyond :)      "

pgp31273,MANOJ KUMAR,Parisian,Sleeper,Aalsi,"Monsieur! Bonjour. Ca va? With so many memories, from first induction session till the end of Paris, I wonder what can I cover in one testimonial. Hence I won't even try to put too much here. Thanks for everything during Paris man. In a way this is more of an ESCP testimonial, but whatever. All the best aage bhai. I know you will do great. Take care man! See you on the other side of Lucknow soon!                                          "
pgp31274,Mansi Pimple,Sarcasm,,, I hope the world turns out to be the way you imagined it.   
pgp31274,Mansi Pimple,WildChild,,,"So basically I adopted this kid in the first year and now she's all grown up to be my mom! But she does possess time-warging superpowers: one moment she'll be an innocent child, next she'll be this gyaani grandma only to next be rebellious teen gangsta! You're crazy in the best possible way because there poetry in your soul! I can blindly trust your advice and know you have best intentions for me. You've been the person I can openly be crazy & stupid with, without the fear of being judged. You've taught me so much, whether knowingly or unknowingly.. You're hands down the hottest property on campus *wink wink* and though there have been times when I've wanted to strangle you, I've always loved you more :) I'll always be around, just a text away :* <bearhug>         "
pgp31274,Mansi Pimple,Dog-lover,Sleeping_Beauty,,"I have never seen anyone caring and loving dogs the way you do. Hats-off. I will miss catching you sleep in class sitting in one position and opening eyes without moving. Will always cherish your birthday party which was super fun, our Deadpool outing, walks and talks on the way to mess, chit-chatting in the hostel and much more. You are an amazing person who is sweet, helpful and fun to be with always. I hope to enjoy with you for years to come. Keep in touch and all the best for your future :)      "
pgp31274,Mansi Pimple,Beautiful,Silent,,"Somehow, another one those good friends from campus with whom I spent very few moments, but again, some really good ones at it.

pgp31275,Marut  Taneja,Sincere,Fun,,"Dost, mast hai tu. Extremely sincere and hard working, you are fun to be with. I still remember clearly the MoC project where we tried our level best to do least possible work and still ended up scoring highest marks in class! Other memories include playing the Atomix game during finals and Kanika's birthday celebration in first year. I am sure you'll excel at whatever you do thanks to your sincerity. All the best :)            "
pgp31275,Marut  Taneja,Smart,,," I felt extremely good when I came to know that you are from NIT, it was like finding a known person among strangers. It was really amazing doing case preparations together. Thank you for all the support. Stay in touch           "
pgp31275,Marut  Taneja,SandeseAateHai,,,"You gave me company when it came to donning winter caps or ranting about everything in this world during those 2 months of internship. The 'Sandese aate hai' moments during INDEX parties have been the best, the lamest and definitely the most memorable. We eventually ended up loving & hating similar set of people. You better take care of our mutual friend.:D Your simplicity, kind-heartedness, and candour is amazing. We will obviously stay in touch. See you bro!       "
pgp31275,Marut  Taneja,Type,Hard,Big,"Marut is my big brother in INDEX. Everytime I mess something up, he's there to scold me and at the same time give me good advice. We may have had our fights and our fall outs but in the end, INDEX wouldn't be what it is without this guy.       "
pgp31275,Marut  Taneja,Angry,,," You are the one person I can always rely upon...If I recall the last 2 years you are the one constant that I see - be it partying, exam preparation, hanging out, seeking advice, INDEX.  Our operations field visits :p, roaming here and there for sponsorship, discussions about INDEX, fighting over small issues sums up most of my life at IIM Lucknow. Thanks for sharing all that with me. I know nothing is gonna change after campus. We will be doing the same fun, same discussions, seeking advice from each other even after campus. wish you all the best for future. I am sure you will keep rocking wherever you go. Cheers to the brotherhood :)
   "
pgp31275,Marut  Taneja,Tezi,,,"Ill try to keep this as short as possible, otherwise im pretty sure that these things will get to your head. Looking back now, one of my biggest regrets right now is that why did not become friends sooner and secondly why did i not apply to Index as a committee. Hell, we took almost the same electives(More like, i copied your electives since you seemed like a guy who had an idea what he was doing :P), shared the same stupid jokes over and over, work on endless projects , all the gossips which would typically include words like tezi/behtareen. I would just like to say here that it is thanks to friends like you that helps people like me sustain through the ups and downs @ hell. In the end, i would just like to say that the last year in hell with you has been full of fun     "
pgp31275,Marut  Taneja,INDEX,BFF,,"A stern look and a heart of Gold- this is what describes you best. People who know you well will agree with me. I haven't seen someone who is more hardworking and as brilliant a multi tasker as you are. You always make me wonder how you find time for every dam thing doing double the amount of work I do and even doing it better than anyone else could. I envy your superman qualities and have always tried to emulate a few of those.
 These two years would have been incomplete without you. There is so much I have learnt from you. Your commitment towards the task at hand or be it simply tracking deadlines you've always been a perfectionist.
You are an extremely humble person and that is something that I absolutely admire. You are actually one of the very few people I know who hasn't changed with time (quite literally) and has been selflessly there for me every single time. You are SIMPLY awesome!
I know you well enough to know that that you are going to achieve great heights of success in your life. There is no stopping you now!
All my love and wishes to you.      "
pgp31276,Minal Patel,Carefree,Smart,Loving," Always ready for any plan. Your best quality according to me is that you speak from your heart. You are truly a genuine person. I have never seen you complaining about anything, you are always at peace.  
We spent some lovely time during placements and that's when I talked to you the most, otherwise I mostly found you living in your own shell. You are one person who gel with everyone without involving much in others' life. You are smart, funny in your own ways.
I like your one liners which can shut up even Tonk ki bak bak.
"
pgp31276,Minal Patel,Excellent,Calm,,"All the times when I needed some calmness in my life, your presence has been the solution. Thanks for being the silent support that you have always been. Those late night walks to mess would always be remembered.  "
pgp31276,Minal Patel,Sweet,Smart,,"At first, you appeared to be very quiet. But the closer people get you the more they enjoy your company. I admire the way your brain works while solving cases or during projects.                           "
pgp31276,Minal Patel,Sweetest,Genuine,TRUE,"One of the most amazing person I know on campus. I respect you the most as you know. All the moments like teasing you about shopping in lectures, going for book fair, sharing morning breakfast, and many more. The best would include two months in Mumbai as a roommate. All our outings, meal times, discussing internship, taj trip, bhel in local train, shopping and roaming around every evening, clicking yours n Kriti's twin time pics and many more. The entire two months gave me memories I would cherish for my life. I wish u all the best for your future and stay in touch forever. Making and referencing all our secret jokes.                  "
pgp31276,Minal Patel,Caring,Intelligent,Understanding,"Minal..First day first friend at IIM L! And I am glad I met you that night when we had just come in. It doesn't matter how long we've been friends, what matters is how much smiles, laughs, tears, good times we've shared in that period. Starting from watching Shinchan, night mess, shopping & what not, we have lived lots of moments together. You are admired for so many reasons and will be missed surely. Stay blessed!       "

pgp31277,Nandita Prasad,Nandi,The-cow,,"I had known you before we came to campus. Then we were not friends. But I am happy we became one as knowing someone so sweet, helpful, caring and talented as you is blissful. You are a pack of talent. Be it music, dance, studies, sports, art and craft, entrepreneurial work or anything, Nandi can do anything. I will miss seeing you having fun fights with Navi and Tonk. I felt special when you confided in me for all that was dear to you. I hope we keep in touch forever and keep on building memories as friends. Stay in touch and all the best for your future :)     "

But apart from all that, you have been a great and entertaining person. It is always good to be around you. Stay like that and never let anybody change you. Keep in touch. "
pgp31278,Navi Prasad,Helpful,caring,cheerful,"He is very much hard working and reliable. He never shy away from asking things which he does not know. If there is something he doesn't know then he believes in finding right people for the job this makes him a person who cares about the job well done rather than putting himself above the task. He always does his home work properly and believes in being prepared before presentations. This extra care, background research and empathizing  behavior makes him perfectly fit in any team.  "
pgp31278,Navi Prasad,Sarcasm,Ombre,,"Navi, you've been the darling of secE! You're fun, have a great sense of humour and aren't ever shy to express your thoughts! You've been a patient listener to my rants and always given good advice. I truly apologize for that sweatshirt thing, and you've been such a sport about it! Have a great life Navi, I wish you the very best!   "
pgp31278,Navi Prasad,Wikipedia,MANAC,," You have the information of whole world, from medical to defense to black holes. You have a clean heart and you say on the face if ou dislike something.

pgp31278,Navi Prasad,Humorist,,,"Navi is a person who is very sweet and amusing. You will always see him cracking jokes and those jokes are never bad. He keeps everyone around him cheerful and happy. I remember how people are afraid of him on our section group because he can make fun of anyone, anywhere and anytime. It's good to see him coming to Bangalore along with me so that I can remain happy there too.            "
pgp31278,Navi Prasad,CRAZY!!!,,,"Navi Sir, Aapki gf hai ya nahi ek baar bta do.. Sometimes you act as if you have one and other times you flirt with Nandita ;) Sach sach btao kya scene hai?

pgp31278,Navi Prasad,Parantha-buddy,,,"You are the most amazing person I know on campus. The only one who has the power to pull anyone's leg and take their case.  I will miss watching you fight with Nandi and Ravi, having night mess ka humara special aloo-pyaz parantha and much more. Having shared so many memories with you, I wish to stay in touch with you forever. You are an awesome friend. There are too many things to write but too less words. Will share over our pizza treat that I hope we continue to chat about for years to come. Keep in touch and all the best for your future :)   "
pgp31278,Navi Prasad,Believer,,,"Youre the sweetest, humble & gentle friend I found at campus. Although we never hanged out any time, but we shared some common atribute to have concerns for each other. I remember the time we argued during our OB project meets. Still those have given way to a very good friend I can cherish throughout.
Loved the way we shared ""sarcastic"" comments .  Thank you for being there whenever I needed. Remain what you are - you have ""navi"" (new) happiness throughout life."
pgp31278,Navi Prasad,Navi,,," I really feel exposed and threatened when you are there. Because I surely know k Navi hai to band bajni hi hai. Everyone including you know that you are dassu, but then jis bhi gang me hota hai uska mahol b tu hi banata hai. Be what you are ,except on few occasions :P   "
pgp31278,Navi Prasad,Ever,Sweet,Polite,"We got to know each other only in the 6th term but I have thoroughly enjoyed what all interactions we have had, no matter how little. The LD sessions were weird yet fun and so was trying to fix the router Everytime the router went out. And then your polite attitude to top it off Everytime.I really really hope that the world doesn't contaminate you and that you keep carrying on conducting yourself in the same polite manner as you have done over the past term. All the best for everything ahead my friend. Stay safe, stay healthy.         "
pgp31279,Nishit Dhanuka,Dhanu,-,-,"You are a very sweet and caring person, and also the most lazy one I have seen. Thank you for being there with me. Bless you with all the Aloo Bhujiyas in the world Dhanu.      "

pgp31279,Nishit Dhanuka,Cool,Sophisticated,Classy,"Nishit oozes class. Except when he's eating aloo, he loves aloo too much to bother being classy while eating it. In the initial days of INDEX, I worked most closely with him and got to learn so much. He's one of a kind!      "
pgp31279,Nishit Dhanuka,Aaloo,,, Mr. Richie Rich of our campus. Next INDEX sponsor kra dena ;p.... Your eternal love for Aaloo will always be remembered. Stay in touch :)       
pgp31279,Nishit Dhanuka,Aloo,INDEX,,"Aloo is the first thing that comes to my find when I think of you. How on earth can anyone eat so much Aloo. Infact it was with you that I discovered that there actually exists an 'aloo platter' in the menu!! I'm 100% sure that aloo has some sleep inducing chemical or how else can one justify the number of hours you sleep. 
Not kidding but I'm yet to see someone who is more meticulous and detail oriented as you are. Being a part of the team I've learned so much from you. You've always been there, silently watching every move and correcting it the second anything went wrong. And lastly how can I not mention about how amazing a DJ you play! :D
You have a long way to go and I'm sure you will excel at anything you wish to choose. Wish you all the luck for future! 
Love,
Kanika      "
pgp31279 ,Nishit Dhanuka,Aaloo,Obviously!,Marketing," The Aaloo Boy. Such a warm personality. It was just awesome to have known you bro. Love your Hindi, your dance and your 'Sahi Baat Hai' :P The only person who doesn't agree with L being Hell. The person who used to sleep for 12 hours even 1st term when people hardly managed to sleep. Still came out acing the summers. Such effortlessness! Highly competitive as well. Conducting INDEX was so easy with you around. Your immaculate planning and eye for detail is next to none. Wish you all the best for your business bhai. Hope that this friendship remain forever :)"
pgp31280,Vamsidhar Nuthalapati,Bestie,,," In one word, all I would say, my BESTIE!! You're the only one with whom I can freely share anything and everything. The rapport we share is unmatchable. I can never forget your support during the initial days on campus. Anything I had to share, any difficulty I had, I knew you were always there :) Will surely miss those wonderful moments spent together. Wish you the best ra!!             "
pgp31280,Vamsidhar Nuthalapati,Chicken_specialist,,, Macha your cooking is superu macha.....thank you for all those chicken moments and I always remember your single expression euro pics               
pgp31280,Vamsidhar Nuthalapati,Understanding,,,"Hey Stex guy (the only one to go to stex from Splashers), throughout these two years, I was always waiting to see you getting bored and tired of parties. Of late, I got to know that kids show high amount of enthusiasm in parties :P. I always wondered about your motivation behind paying mess fee in spite of ordering day in and out from outside. Sometimes, I even felt you should vacate your room in L and start doing up and downs from C. You have proved that bankers can be inventory managers, being an unofficial member of Click N Pick. I have always envied you thinking how someone can be so lucky to end up in a decade long abroad role that too after completing an entire term in foreign university.  
Al the best Vamsidhar, on a serious note, I have always admired your way of understanding others and their viewpoints.
     "
pgp31280,Vamsidhar Nuthalapati,Kiddo,,," My first encounter, you reminded me of my engineering first year (Innocent), but as everyone says never judge a book by its cover, you proved me wrong. You are Chotta dhamaka but with unparalleled laziness. I call you Chotta dhamaka because the way you managed the orders in our first click 'n' pick deal indeed proved me that best things come in small packages.
Laziness part -I have never thought someone would beat me in laziness (just sitting in the room and watching TV series).

                           "
pgp31280,Vamsidhar Nuthalapati,Kid,Caring,Smart," Though we graduated from the same college our friendship started very late (I regret that). You will be my chill pill whenever I am stressed. Vamsi, I will miss you a lot after college, especially if you are going on international stints :P . Stay blessed dude and keep loving sailu and keep chilling   "
pgp31280,Vamsidhar Nuthalapati,Chill,,,Quite a chilled-out and smart guy (In all senses). The way you imitated Profs was very humorous. I wish you all the best for your future.         
pgp31281,Ojas Gohad,Cheerful,Busy,Practical,One of the litty (literary + witty) people on campus. Anti-globe anti-bookish and believes in doing things hands on... it has been fun to hang out whenever we did :)
pgp31281,Ojas Gohad,Mooooo,,,"Oj, The Baws, Moo…so many names by which I call you :P Our journey started from me and Tushar looking at your profile pictures across social media, after your texts on the Telegram book…har picture mey alag dikhti hai ye ladki :D Then I will ill when we met, and you took care of me. Since then, we've been friends for soooo long, always having someone to talk to, no matter regarding what and no matter what the time be. We've had fun together on our dates, various parties and even simple heart-to-heart chats that we have had every now and then. I found solace in you in my dark days and courage to fight when things went wrong. You are the sister I never had, and through you I found family here at hel(L). You made my two years a lot more fun and easier than they would have otherwise been. Thank you for being such a darling friend. Love :*      "

pgp31281,Ojas Gohad,Charming,,," Ojas means Virility, strength, Splendour, Power, Energy, and anyone who knows Ojas Gohad would testify that she lives upto her name. She is destined to be great. Most know the side of Ojas that is mature, hardworking, kind and ambitious woman waiting to burst into limelight but few know the other side of her. A 16 year old teenager whose interest in life is to paint, to decorate her room with lights and designs, to derive fun from all silly things around her. I would miss the conversations we had in that nicely lit room and of course the mushroom cheese tikka :)"
pgp31281,Ojas Gohad,Cool,Smart,Relaxed,The forever memory i have of you is the one from rafting..When we were panicked you were so cool as it was a swimming pool..i have not known you for a long time..but i somehow i feel you are not made to sign documents in a corporate office but to write and spread words for others to read and enjoy..be cool as u r always! You are different and stay different!              
pgp31281,Ojas Gohad,Ojas,Motu,," I guess I know you from first year, but yaad nhi exactly when did I meet you for the first time! May be in mess or something! But what I have observed about you is that you keep asking questions unless you are convinced from the answers! That surely irritates me, but I like it the most about you as well. Bahot fights hui hai dono ki iss saal and there were many times when we colluded together! I wish aise hi rahe yeh sab! :) Be in touch bro! :D "
pgp31281,Ojas Gohad,Mature,Understanding,Passionate,"One and only friend of mine from HeLL, before I even came here!! I have thoroughly enjoyed whatever time I have spent with you. You are truly an amazing and understanding person I have met at IIML.  
We might not have quantity of time but we do have quality of time to look back. I would be really happy to meet you whenever we can make it possible and add few more moments to our memory.  
 "
pgp31281,Ojas Gohad,Vivacious,,,"One of the most lively people on this campus, I've had the misfortune (haha) of meeting her and having her around. She is everywhere and anywhere and is there for everyone at all times. :)     "
pgp31281,Ojas Gohad,Cheerful,Socializer,,It has always been great interacting with you. I still remember the Zerba incident and the things that followed.. It was fun.. :D You don't get offended and see the lighter side of things... It has been fun interacting with you.. Do stay in touch :)

pgp31281,Ojas Gohad,Cupcakeness,,,My first IIM mommy. Diametrically opposite and how! You have taught me so much about the 'real' world - whether I wanted to learn or not. I hope you find a world that makes you truly happy and where people get all the subtle hints.    
pgp31281,Ojas Gohad,Sister,Benchie,Conversations,Ojas was my benchmate for the whole of first year and I don't know what I would have done if not for her company to keep me sane. She's the sister I wish I had and she's damn cool. Try and keep up with her :P     
pgp31281,Ojas Gohad,GossipGirl,,," One can talk to her about anything for so long..be it personal life, college life or any other crap. And Dude that day you were high too (you know which night i am talking about :p). Also, the episode with Charles..haha can't forget that! Sorry for bringing it up, but someone has to mention about your chocolate boy :D. Although we disagree on so many topics, its always good to talk to you over pizzas and wine. I wish we could have planned our grad trip together.      "
pgp31281 ,Ojas Gohad,TeaPartner,l,l,"Hey Ojas, I remember the endless discussions we had on completely random topics! It was so much fun, sitting in your room (or mine), sipping tea and having intense conversations on a lot of things. And even though we became friends only in the second year, I believe I have made a friend for life.. Stay in touch bro..try to make as many people smile as you can! wish you all the very best in life :)     "
pgp31282,R Sharath Kumar,Chetan Bhagat,,," First friend on the campus, open minded, genuine, helpful and level headed (condition: provided the girls are not around). Really enjoyed our Dota games, philosophical discussions, and endless parties.

All the very best to the Chetan Bhagat of IIM Lucknow for his future, thank you for everything
"
pgp31282,R Sharath Kumar,SocialWomanizer,,," You are the person with whom I had 1st conversation (it still holds true ) on this campus. Thanks for read proofing all my write ups & sharing your expensive perfumes with me. Those 2 months of summer internship with you in Gurgaon was best days of my life. I really cherished our friendship & hope you would make next Chetan Bhagat of India.

There is so much i shared with you, and hope we continue sharing our writings and our thoughts in the same happy, non-judgemental way :) will miss you :)    "
pgp31282,R Sharath Kumar,Charmer,Warm,Weirdo,"how can one express in words the boundless love they hold for their dear ones, more so when the dear one is an exceptional writer. Sharath, You know me in ways even I can't understand. TBH, sometimes I don't get your music, your books, your writing, your philosophy but the way you talk about them.The passion, the fire is infectious. I love that Sharath. Never let anything dull that. Needless to say, You are one of my favorite person & I love you <3    "
pgp31282,R Sharath Kumar,Creative,Nigger,Creep, Love you nigger P.S:- I am the only one who have the right to call you this. I am extremely proud of you that you had the guts to chose the path less taken. I know you will be successful at it one day. Keep the passion and don't forget dedicate the books to me and me. I am gonna stay in touch with you whether you like it or not. 
pgp31282,R Sharath Kumar,3AMFriend,,,He's the go to guy. Lost your room keys in the middle of the night? He'll break the lock for you (even if he is drunk). Depressed because life is a sux? He'll drink with you. He thinks he's emo and deep but he's probably the most jovial guy you can come across. But I guess he needs to be that if the next bestseller on the block needs to be his. It's true I tune you out when you start talking crazy but that's part of this dynamic so its okay. But it's also true that I don't know how I would have gotten through some of the hardest phases in my life without you. I might have gotten through them but not remained sane after. I've had too many adventures with you on campus right from improving our aim to getting scared by our own horror stories. One of the few good surprises from this campus. I will always (mostly) ensure that you don't look like a retard alone. :)  
pgp31282,R Sharath Kumar,Adorable,Annoying,,"You Sir, have made one whole year of my Hell life bearable just by being in it! A crazily imaginative writer, a passionate gamer, an amazing listener, an annoying groupmate, superzealous rapper and a drowsy-benchmate-whom-I've-kicked-a-lot-under-the-table-to-wake-up is what you've been for me.. You're hands down adorable and I totally love you so much! Keep writing, you crazy-rich-awesome SonofaGun!               "

You have always been there whenever I needed any help. I always learnt something from you whenever we were together( Keep aside the time when Golu was around)...I was actually one of the happiest person when I got to know that you are going to follow your dream...I wish you all the luck for your future and I demand the first autographed copy of your book. :) :)

pgp31282,R Sharath Kumar,Booker-Boy,,,"You are an amazing friend. One who respects people a lot. I really loved taking your case in every forty two meeting and teasing you for the same.

Keep in touch and all the best for your future :)  "

pgp31282,R Sharath Kumar,Death Matal Vocalist,INDEX,,"You are a Rockstar Sharath. Your dance moves on the south Indian songs are the most difficult dance form I've seen so far and I guess I need classes from you to perfect them. The passion that you carry for your dreams and aspirations is truly inspiring. You are one person who has had the weirdest experiences in life and hence have so many different instances to share.
Always enjoy life like you do and keep that smile on.
Love,
Kanika"
pgp31282 ,R Sharath Kumar,cool,writer,," The all-rounder of INDEX and the most colourful guy as well. A bit lazy but does the work perfectly. Amazing speaker and a writer. No surprises that he chose that as his career. Takes lot of courage to sit out of placements and pursue your own dreams. Immense respect for that! Would so miss the time spent during meetings, parties, INDEX work. Wish you an amazing and a successful journey ahead. :) "
pgp31283,RAGHAV ARORA,Fin-god,sorted,future_politician,"You are probably the most knowledgeable and most sorted person I have seen on campus. Your command over finance is unparalleled. Let alone finance - jiske to aap God ho yaha, you have knowledge about every damn thing and you are so down-to-earth. Although we didnt have that much interaction but still there was some level of respect and friendship in its own way. I sincerely hope that you achieve great heights in life and fulfill your end goal of correcting this system because afterall "" Galat aadmi se panga le liya logo ne :D "".

pgp31283,RAGHAV ARORA,Focused,,,"Dear Institue rank holder, you have been my bench mate since day-1 at IIM Lucknow. It was very cherished to learn along with you in the class. As the saying in our class used to go, ""Raghav spills over half of his marks to both his neighbors."" and I was one lucky receiver at one side. I hope me and Kalyani didn't trouble you much during the first year :). Me and you have seen lot of things togeather at the campus and those things have only strengthened the brother bond between us. I know you will do all best things in your life. All the best for ahead.       "

I will always miss meeting you in night mess as a Jihadi, you two doubts you asked profs in one go which they couldn't answer, our Mumbai outings, mess chats and much more. You are a talented, intelligent and kind person. Hope you get all your dreams fulfilled. I'll come for your campaigns. Keep in touch and all the best for your future :)  "
pgp31283,RAGHAV ARORA,Topper,DU,Bus Conductor ,Tera toh night mess wala kurta yaad rahega. First year mein class mein bahut maje aaye tujhse baat kar kar. Bahut mehnati hai yaar tu. Tujhe dekhkar mujhe complex aa jaata tha. Punjab ka sherr hai tu. Teri 'Geeta' wali batein bhi bahut badhiya thi. Kabhi time laga toh mein bhi padhunga Geeta.  
pgp31283,RAGHAV ARORA,Baba,,," The balance that you keep in the things that you do I amazing. You used to knew that you have to study for two hours but also used knew that you want to teach us for few hours. I always remember those instructions from you, ""9-10 aa jana FRA padhane. Time pe ana, 10 baje close kar denge"" types. Everyone knows about your intellect and may write about it but you are really good at heart too and particularly would be a great teacher. Though I know you will do much more than that but some day when you retire, try that, you will help making future. &#61514;

From the CV reviews during Summer placements to organising birthday parties we did witness the whole spectrum of emotions together.After all this, I feel qualified enough to write a few words about you.You are a very hardworking, sincere, talented guy and it would be tough for anything or anyone to stop you from achieving anything you desire. Your humility and being grounded accentuates your personality.You are a great friend and one which helps others in their time of need.Words could not express our experiences at IIM Lucknow, which were from interesting to downright crazy.There is no advice that I can give to you for your future.All the best for life.                   "
pgp31284,Ravi Jain,Intelligent,Reliable,,"Hey Ravi I got to know you much better in second year. And I discovered a great guy. You are sincere, intelligent and reliable. I remember the time we were in a group together and you literally pulled the weight of the whole group by yourself. Amazon is so lucky to have selected you and so am I that we are going to be coworkers. I wish you all the best for your personal and professional life ;) Maintain the same energy that you have in the future as well and you are going to do great.            "
pgp31284,Ravi Jain,Bizarre,,,One person who could irritate the hell out of me and at the same time make me laugh on all his bewakoofi. You are an excellent person and a wonderful friend beneath all the shenanigans that you do  
pgp31284,Ravi Jain,Motu,Light_lo,Chill_maro,"It was fine when Ravi blatantly copied my name. But it wasn't fine when he did collude with the weighing machine to show me heavier than him. Anyway, what can I say about him! Too much, actually. He needs to work a lot on his general chat. He should realize that there are so many other words apart from ""light lo"" and ""chill maro"", which unfortunately now form 99% of his vocabulary. I mean it was either this, or it was about how unfairly he got just 49.5 out of 50 in a quiz. It truly takes the real Ravi to not be happy or satisfied about topping alone in CVR. But I hate to admit that Ravi might be the best person to hang out with. One would realize that the best jokes in the world aren't the ones that are carefully and meticulously planned and thought about. He will make you reach for a box of tissues and your aching stomach while laughing continuously on everyday happenings. His wit is unparalleled, and so is his competitiveness. He can make so much fun of your name, for example, that you will want to change it altogether. Right from the moment he entered hostel 9, it was really very nice talking to him on an everyday basis, and most importantly looking up to him for setting new upper limits on human weight. Thanks a ton, dude!  "
pgp31284,Ravi Jain,Motu,,,God knows how I passed one year by sitting aside you. But you are still a child. tujhe jab tickling karte thhe. udhar se kalyani and idhar se me. all the best and be in touch motu.

From hitting me with pens (which you definitely were bad at) to trying to kill me by choking me!!But even after so many mood swings of your I wonder how we still are friends. I think it's mostly because of me and my patience :P But Ravi yaha se nikalne k baad kaise hoga tumhara!

pgp31284,Ravi Jain,Gym buddy,,," I came to know Ravi in my 2nd year, when we became wing-mates. He was the person who used to wake me up for gym in the morning, when it was impossible for me to wake up on my own (and we 2 were on a competition to get in better shape than other). He is a very kind hearted person, helpful (during placements, he used to be present there full time helping and supporting others) and never gets offended by any amount of teasing."
pgp31284,Ravi Jain,Great_Companion,,,"If you joke about something and then the other guy takes it to the another level cracking up the entire group, then nothing can beat his companionship. Ravi is that guy in the group. He makes fun of everyone and never hesitates to joke about himself too. ""M&A and AMS classes were crazy man. I never thought being back-benchers would be so much fun, but one of the factors was your company, of course. You have the power to make people laugh just by talking along with them. Keep the spirit high""  "
pgp31284,Ravi Jain,Krantikaari,,,"Dude, we have been wingies for the whole of two years and I feel glad that it was so. You bring energy to the wing and among your friends - your laughter is infectious. You have a great sense of humour. I admire how you take up any unjust occurrence and pursue to correct it - you are courageous when others are laid back and I want you to always be so. You have helped me out twice to crack StanC and I have blindly relied upon your skills, yes :D . Wishing you all the very best for a fantastic future ahead.  "

She can make a stranger feel quite at home anywhere, anytime....
Does what she wants to do and speaks what she feels like. She is what she is, there is no hidden face beneath her... Does not hesitate to say things on the face of the other person, friend or foe. She is a friend of friends and does not pretend friendship with someone whom she does not want to befriend. All the best for your future...     "

Non-stop sessions of cards at your room playing 17 or poker will always be with me. Jaipur trip is also one of the few memories which I carry with myself. You have been an amazing friend. Hope that we will able to continue like that in future too. All the best for your career. Wishing you a lifetime of happiness.  "

Kalyani I want to thanks for all the support, for bearing me 2 complete years. Do you remember all our fight at almost all places in campus- your room, my room, corridors, Mess, Section parties or even in a class in front of Rocky. I am sure that all these fights just added spice to our friendship and then came my new-year resolution :D. I am sure that you enjoyed our friendship and gonna miss me in future.

pgp31285,KALYANI REWATKAR,Pav_Bhaji,Kaalu,The_Marathi_kudi,"Your smile is so comforting and motivating that anyone can forget its problems by just looking at your face. There are some friends who are contextual friends and then there are friends who are BFFs, but you are beyond them as well.. you are a friend who completely changed my perspective of things. You made me realise the positive side of everything. You helped me in my worst of the times and hope you will continue to do the same.                "
pgp31285,KALYANI REWATKAR,Kaalu,,," Kaalu, the bacha of the gang! :D	Apni Jaipur trip was one of the best, no fight and probably the easiest trip we had in the past two years. Taking wonderful photos, to eating the delicious Chowki Dhani food, to shopping for the whole day and some senti talks on the way back. It was during the return journey that I realised that you are more mature than we actually give you credit for. :) 	Be the cheerful, bindaas girl that you are and life would be just as beautiful to you. 	All the best Kalu :)   "
pgp31285,KALYANI REWATKAR,Kaalu,,," Kaalu is little girl in the group full of enthusiasm and a boisterous charm. Being from the same college at under graduation, we often shared insider jokes and lingo. Rebellious by nature, she often shocked people around with her acts and witty remarks. There has been an occasion when she lampooned a professor in his own chamber.  She has one of the best decorated room which clearly reflects her eye to detail and an innate ability to bring out the best from everyday objects. A 'bindas' soul who will be ready to break some bones if at all you need such kind of a favour. A tiny creature by appearance, but has the memory of an elephant and she can will often narrate events with super fine details.  Fun Fact: She has a thing for the battery operated rickshaws and would be more than happy to go on an all-day ride. Survival Tip:  Never let a disagreement escalate to a point where she is allowed to take up arms and ammunition. Song Dedication: Suno Aisha, Aisha. "
pgp31285,KALYANI REWATKAR,Kalu,,,You come across as one person who remains happy and content amd cheerful with yourself. It's difficult to say the same for everyone. I sometimes envy you for that ! Hope you have a great life ahead !! Good luck !

You were the go-to-guy for me to discuss anything. Accenture trip was icing on the cake, something which we will remember for a long time to come… You are such a stud, handling Index, controls and still getting a 8 pointer…Insti Ranker, the lady's man and the friendliest face on campus… You will go places, the hard worker you are and keep making me proud… Deloitte is lucky to have you Nonu, All the best…:)

We actually had our first conversation standing in the line to get a room in front of SA Office and that must be the only time I have seen you clean shaven. You were a great brother at arms in controls and one of those who was always rational yet fun. Your long naps during Finals, sleeping through the whole pressure and waking up to control the whole phones alone. But the way you would handle acads with controls, #respect.     "

Sadly, the above mentioned lines are complete globe and i have to delve into the finer details of our friendship. I still remember how you were in awe of my CV yo begin with at first and how that gradually turned the other way around. Bhai, i want to thank you for not looking at the age difference or the level of maturity difference between us for a second in any interaction. While i was presuming that you'd not be an easy person to be friends with, you went ahead and treated me like a younger brother. Thanks for every advice, night-outs for quizzes and most of all just for being there when i needed a helping hand. Hope to see this friendship go beyond MBA.     "

I will never understand how can one guy manage so many things at once and still manage to do them so well. 
You have been one great friend and for me INDEX parties would never have been with same without you.

Coincidentally we both were inducted into the same section, contested for the same position of Operations Vertical in INDEX together and finally got selected as well. You are the best person one can have as a friend. Cares a lot about everyone, always ready to help, always smiling and cracking PJs :P. Had so much fun spending 2 years of MBA with you bro. The night outs for exams, roaming Lucknow on bike for INDEX work, parties, Dreamz and so many other memories which are going to remain with me for life. I really admire the way you manage all your work without getting even a little frustrated. Wish all the success to you in life and hope our friendship gets stronger by the day. Stay the way you are.

I wonder how you do that.You have absolutely no ill-feelings for anyone, no grudges against anyone, no jealousy, no hatred, no bad feelings at all. You mesmerise me! I respect you for your decision to sit out of the placements to fulfil your dreams... takes courage! And then there's this absolutely crazy side to you that drives me nuts. You know no bounds...You jump into the seas, climb unclimbable mountains, dance in front of the strangers and what not! And you like EVERYTHING on earth. From mess food to flop movies, everything! And yet this mind boggling energy of yours is extremely positive, thrilling and full of good vibes. I'm lucky to have met you and our journey at IIM L has been nothing short of amazing! Snooker, TT, Prom, your singing, dancing, our oh-so-awesome EURO TRIP, photo shoots, our adda, times we spent doing absolutely anything – are some of the unforgettable moments.You're one of the best things that have happened to me in IIML!

He is hard working, courageous, talented and a good person, all the qualities required for a successful leader. He surprises me at times with the things he does and the lines in which he thinks. I would never want to lose contact with such person.            "
pgp31287,Jay Shah,CR,Siyaar,Jai,"It is very difficult to find such a confident person as Jay. And it's all the more remarkable to be that way all the time. I remember once Jay was presenting on behalf of our group in an HR course. He was so confident and enthusiastic that it unnerved the professor to ask any question, and thankfully so because he was conjuring up new definitions of the old terms. At once I began wondering whether I had read the same article as he did. But then I realized that the slides were made by me! Such impactful was the presentation that people clapped wholeheartedly at the end not realising that he had made his way around with so much 'globe'. Taking this ability forward, Jay has this special habit of boosting the morale of others when they need it. And you will find him helping others on his own. It was a lot of fun to be in his company and learn from him. Hope he keeps up the good work. "
pgp31287,Jay Shah,CRRRRRRR,,,I regard you as a man of ethics. I think your greatest ability is to take decisions without compromising on ethics. You have taken a discussion to venture out and I fully in support of that. Would love to contribute in whatever way possible for that. ALL the best for life and be in touch 
pgp31287,Jay Shah,Euphoric,,,"Yo Jay !! Dude how you keep ur moral up God knows man.. Section 'E' would not have been so memorable without you.

pgp31287,Jay Shah,CR,Whatsup,Aiyyayo," CR Take Care. The very first time I met you was before section division, to watch ABCD2. Then I found you sitting in the same row as I was in class. The entire year went by troubling you during your peaceful lecture sleeps, especially I am watching you gesture we shared. Or finding you jogging in the morning and asking wassup for which I always had a weird answer. Also, I cannot forget one surprising fact that we never agreed to any idea but always respected each others opinion and the talks we shared. You always had super extra long single sentenced questions with super tough words which even professors could not remember after a minute, and I still wonder how were you able to answer correctly even when you were sleeping so soundly.You are one person I know will always be there smiling and ready to help despite your problems.Just remember, I have booked my employment in your firm already. ( No backing out on this :P ). And start remembering birthdays...  There is so much more to write, but then I guess since we are going to stay in contact forever, will keep praising, teasing, bugging and enjoying with you the most humble, talented and sweet friend I have.                    "
pgp31287,Jay Shah,Receptive,Leader,Trouble shooter,"With the innate capabilities you are gifted you sets you class apart from all of us.

pgp31287,Jay Shah,ThePositiveGUy,,," I keep praising you again n again for the kind of person you are, so didn't know what different shall I write. So writing what I have never. It feels amazing when someone keeps track of you and what is there on face and ask you, ""Are you OK?"" You get it right 100% of time and the help that pressure go off. I am really looking forward to contribute to whatever extent I can, to spread the Positivity. 

  "
pgp31288,Sharanya Halady,Interesting,Talkative,Charming," I am always amazed by the fact that you know 6 languages. You remember we first met during IIM L interview at this very place only and we talked quite a lot in our first meet. You are a lot similar to me in terms of talking a lot and never afraid of new experiences. My best and never forgettable memory with you is crashing parties together and acting like as if we belong to that party. 
You are an interesting person and full of fun and life. Keep your spirit alive. 
I am really happy that we will be moving to same city and will have more fun.

pgp31288,Sharanya Halady,Telegu,,, Your friendly attitude and caring for everyone is something to cherish. I will always remember you always commenting on the neatness of my room and me cleaning it afterwards. Eating in the 555 restaurant was an amazing experience. Lets do t again but this time it will be your treat.            
pgp31288,Sharanya Halady,Happy,,,All the parties would not have been the same without your energy. Thanks for being the super energetic and super fun friend you have been  
pgp31288,Sharanya Halady,Fun,carefree,,"Sharanya is both carefree and serious, hard-working types. She dedicates time and effort to few important things and for the rest, she will be like, ""light lo"". She just speaks her heart out, mostly in self-praise, but its totally endearing and funny. You are quite awesome Sharanya and I love you!  "
pgp31288,Sharanya Halady,Cute,Smart,,"We started talking more in second year after being wingies and I found out what a cool person you are! You're pretty, smart, honest and hard working; and I'm sure you'll make it big one day! Keep smiling and stay awesome.. Mwah, much love!          "
pgp31288,Sharanya Halady,Sharp-minded,,,"Sharnaya, a person who is always calm, composed and ever-green smiling. She is a good friend and even nicer person by heart. Contrary to her age, she is more mature than many person here. She lives her life to fullest and yet is very sincere.

pgp31288,Sharanya Halady,Lively,,,"Smart, bubbly and someone who is very lively at social events is what comes to my mind when I think about Sharanya. She is mature yet innocent from within.

pgp31289,Shashwat  Sharma,thinker,caring,adventurous," He can accomplish any task given to him with finesse. He prefers not to show how much he care about people around him but he is a very caring person. What surprises me is that he manages to be both bold and soft at the same time. Adventure, Journey, fun, logic these things drive his life. For him what is right is right and what is wrong is wrong no matter who is saying it. His philosophy of life is equal rights and fair treatment to everybody which he actually practices.      "
pgp31289,Shashwat  Sharma,Mandi,Chill,PartyBoy,"Shashwat, you're one of the friendliest and nicest people I know! We started off with that Delhi/Mumbai conversation and it was a cool journey since!

pgp31289,Shashwat  Sharma,Neighbor,BhandInsaan,,You have been a confidante sometimes. Classes in first year would have been super boring without you :D                    
pgp31289,Shashwat  Sharma,Sasawat,,,"I would not have survived the entire year, every lecture and every moment if it was not with you by my side. I will miss sitting next to you for the whole first year. We have enjoyed so much that I still burst out laughing just by thinking about it. Air tickling you, playing games on mobile with you, watching people play, sleep and fight from our place,  gossiping about so many things, the last day bike ride to watching a late night movie and then having to pull the bike at the last moment, and much more. You will always be the most incredible friend I have. Plus I know I am going to bug you for years to come so no chance that you are allowed to forget me :P All the best for your future and stay the way you are (well with all the modifications I keep on suggesting :P )  "

pgp31289,Shashwat  Sharma,Baba,,,"Oldest friend, neighbour - mentor (in some things), I have always admired how energetic you are. I mean, only 3 hours of sleep will definitely knock my senses out but you were able to deliver everything right from academics to being the life of the party in the bestest way. And 99.95, well, mind=blown. We have had some very great times - partying, studying, travelling, gossips - first year was really exciting. And its good to have a foreign bound friend - bhai bula lena jaldi :P . Wishing you all the very best for an adventurous fantabulous future. "
pgp31290,Shresthi Agarwal,,,,
pgp31290,Shresthi Agarwal,brave,no_nonsense_girl,,"This UP ki bombastic lady wouldnt take nonsense for an answer. The most sorted, straight foward person i met in this largely convoluted world. Shresthi, i knew you before 42, but working with you only made my respect for you grow. Hope you achieve the greatest heights, the ones you truly deserve. Stay in touch, dost :)     "
pgp31290,Shresthi Agarwal,Passionate,Talkative,,"We interacted mostly during the last days on campus and I am glad we did. You are strong as a boulder and as capable as anyone. I am really really happy to have known you, and the fact that you're equally talkative as me ensures we'd definitely stay in touch. And yes, I am yet to see your Kindle !!  "
pgp31290,Shresthi Agarwal,SRK,Funny,Hard,"Sometimes we meet people with whom we can feel connected instantly. Shresthi is one of those people. We first talked during summers placement process, after spending almost one and half year in the hell. We share the same level of madness,  we can crack jokes on which only we will laugh. She is one of the kindest & funny girls but is too 'naazuk'. She had many fractures, as she told me once. Shresthi is not one who will run after having a number of friends but only desires few good friends. But in front of her, her friends can always be what they truly are. Apart from her silly jokes, I will also not forget milk-container shaped coffee mug of hers. She even managed to make me watch one SRK movie with her in the college auditorium. She is such a big SRK fan that she even has a srk-looking friend too. I wish that she get what she has been trying to achieve since past 8 years or so. ;) Don't be afraid of present obstacles girl, you will do good in your life. Good luck!     "
pgp31290,Shresthi Agarwal,Intelligent,,,You have a very distinctive and strong personality. I am sure you will do great in the future. I wish you all the very best.

You surely didn't have much luck in the past 2 years, but do remember, someday this hard-work would overpower luck and you would get all that you rightly deserve... You have the right attitude to excel in life. Do well and keep in touch :) "
pgp31290,Shresthi Agarwal,,,,
pgp31290,Shresthi Agarwal,Reliable,truthteller,trustworthy," Apart from being a very talented and intelligent person, she is a very trustworthy person. Once she is a friend she will support you in all the situations given you are right. She gives an honest opinion in all matters whether it be professional or personal. She does not panic and does her work with dedication, also she doesn't give up and this makes her capable of achieving all the success.   "
pgp31290,Shresthi Agarwal,Tenacious,Strong,,"Shreshthi, you're a very strong person! A writer, a very sincere & hard working student and a beautiful human being! Don't ever change, you're great! Cheers!               "
pgp31290,Shresthi Agarwal,Sympathetic,,,"
This one year of PGP2 was happier & more beatiful for me & one of the reasons is you. It is very hard to find a friend who share common belief. I will remember all the campus walks, mess visits, festival celebrations together. For going to mess or classroom - you are more punctual than any clock.
Believe the best in everything - have big success in future."

pgp31290,Shresthi Agarwal,Real,Honest,,"Since the time we met for the 1st time in Nitie , I've always admired you for your straight-forward attitude. I love that you never try to pretend or take things for granted. Furthermore, after spending 2 months with you in Mumbai, I found you have great taste in food (So we connected over Poha :P). It was great knowing you and I'm glad that we met and we are friends today. Wish you all the very best for future. Stay connected. God bless. "
pgp31290,Shresthi Agarwal,Hardworking,,,"We met through Devika, & got to know each other in Placement Operations. Your dedicated & hardworking nature is beyond words. Once we got to talking, well I couldn't even tell that you are an introvert. The outings, talks & walks were filled with stories of past & aspirations. You are a frank & straightforward person. Stay like that! :) Over the two placement processes & the finals preparation, our friendship grew beautifully. I will miss you. Stay in touch. Friends Forever. All the best & May you get all that you aspire for. Cheers, Tanvi         "
pgp31290 ,Shresthi Agarwal,Shreshthi,l,l,"Hey Shreshthi, We met pretty late during the 2 years at Hell, but I am sure that today we share a friendship that will last a lifetime!

pgp31291,Shubham Tonk,Sexy,Funny,Energetic," You are the glue that keeps our group together. You make us laugh almost all the time except when the jokes are on you. None can get bored in your company.  Such a brilliant and spontaneous actor that everyone can believe you at once. (Can't fool me now, now I know you well).
When I first met you I saw you in your fluorescent green shoes..what a sight it was. And now jewellery wale shoes.. what is it with you. I can never forget your shoes.  
I will be wailting for the day jab tu bada hokar consultant banega.
        "
pgp31291,Shubham Tonk,LifeOfTheParty,Tonk,," You were always the one ready for bakar (making Machau day memorable was one of them). Always being cheerful and having a right perspective is a thing to learn. Whenever we met, making fun of the gang was one of our favorite past time :D. Ab to sir aap kuwait jaayenge..bhoolna mat gareebo ko!!"
pgp31291,Shubham Tonk,Funny,Caring,,"I feel it is already too late but I hope tumhara jo bade hoke banne ka sapna hai woh jaldi poora ho jaaye :P. Teri acting, dance aur bewakoofi bhari kahaniyon ke bina life in IIM Lucknow would have been a little too boring. Thanks for being the dhinchak person that you are. Aur choti choti baaton pe roya mat kar, doesn't suit you.  "
pgp31291,Shubham Tonk,Tonk,Funny,,"Tonk has something funny to tell you or some other trick up his sleeve all the time but he is also someone you can have a serious conversation with or talk about anything. He has been most supportive and helpful in anything that we have done. Inspite of being so different, we have so much in common...it feels like being friends with another version of me and I will miss this the most.    "
pgp31291,Shubham Tonk,PartyKiJaan,BornLeader,,Tere baaton se sabko khush kar deta h tu. Apne group ki jaan h tu. I aspire to one day have as good marketing/business skills as you :P                   
pgp31291,Shubham Tonk,Chota_Packet_Bada_Dhamaka,,,"I remember meeting you the first day of class where you were struggling to keep your chair up (which always managed to sweep down till the last day). You are an amazing person who is brilliant, a caring friend and fun to be with. Will miss your pranks with Nandi (the chalk powder one) and Shweta. Also, you will always be the only person Minal n I could see with his legs entirely resting straight on the table in front. Thank you for always being there as a friend and listening to all I ever had to say. Will miss all the fun I had with you and everyone. Keep in touch and all the best for your future :)  "
pgp31291,Shubham Tonk,Supportive,Intellectual,Humorous,"I must say journey from seat partners to close friends had its own peaks and valleys. You are a person who knows how to handle difficult situations, who can make anyone laugh with his good sense of humor and really cares for people who matter to him. To be honest I can't put our friendship in words and what it means to me. All I have to say is thank you for being part of this two-year journey and making it worth remembering. Hope to stay in touch! "
pgp31291,Shubham Tonk,Tonk,,,Bhai...ab kya kahe..you were always very helpful to me..right from the start and thanks a ton for that...and alhabibi ki kasam tum bahut age jaoge...;p   
pgp31292,Shweta Chauhan,Sweet,Innocent,Captain," You are the sweetest person in campus. You will always be kiddo to me. I remember the first time I met you in mess and you introduced me as my extended family and I was afraid of you revealing my secret. Thanks for not doing. 
You are a tiny person but with strong will power. You built entire basketball team from non-players and won many games. This much strong you are!! So don't let small things come in your way.
Your sweetness and innocence remind me of old me. Stay as you are.
Thanks for capturing moments even when we made fun of you. You are the reason that we have pics and check-in on Facebook :D  
 "
pgp31292,Shweta Chauhan,Chotu,,," Aur Shweta!!! The game which started from Aur Shweta to Fin fin bhai bhai as you were the only one in friends taking Finance, it was great time with you.

Never lose the fighting spirit and love for friends that you have squirrel :-*  "
pgp31292,Shweta Chauhan,Tiny,One-bite,,"Shweta has a childlike curiosity for everything, of wanting to try and experience things and this is what I love most about her. When the rest of us would be too lazy to move, she would keep bugging us to do this and that and eventually we would be happy that we listened to her. I envy her because she eats so much and doesn't have to worry about putting on weight. These two years, we have almost been roommates...I am going to miss all the little things in everyday life like going to mess together or watching movies or simply talking. I hope we stay in touch and I have a feeling we will...always.    "

You are that one person in my life whose actions speak more than words. You might seem to be self-oriented and noticeable only to a few, but you have a beautiful soul with all the shades & colours of life in you. I thought these expressions existed only in books and there you are, a real life case-in-point of all these :P
People say one good book is equal to hundred friends, but a good friend is equal to a library. But for me you are equal to hundred libraries!
            "
pgp31293,Sesh Kumar,Hard,,," Click 'n' Pick helped me to know you better bro. If you believe in what you are doing, you will give more than 100% and motivate others to do. You bring confidence in the discussion and help in the decision making that something I admire. All the best bro !!

My wing mate in both the years at campus, Batsa has been a ""Star"" performer in every aspect of life at Hell – Winning multiple campus and corporate events, hosting and joining late night parties, not worrying/studying for most of the exams and still getting decent marks, and comical stand ups mimicking the popular of the lot! And he does all of this with perfection. With an uncanny knack of handling pressure tasks/situations, soothing the ambience with his witty remarks and pulling up the enthu of the group, and hitting the gym regularly to remain fit and active come what may, I believe he has a bright future and wish he achieves all he wants to in life, without any hiccups."

pgp31295,Sribatsa Pathy,Superstar,,," I don't know where this guy gets some much energy. We think alike and thats the best kind of friend you hope to find here. Very competitive even though he does'nt show it blatently, something that I should have learnt from him. "
pgp31295,Sribatsa Pathy,WhatTheHell,,,"This space and words aren't enough to portray the awesomeness that is you. I am just disappointed I did not know this awesome personality in the first year. Your jokes, sarcasm, one liners always kept the mood light wherever you are. Couple that with a love for comics, movies, series, and you have got a fan in me. Your prowess to turn anything into a humoros comment but also not taking it lightly and always fulfilling your responsibility is a trait i really admire. The way you handled P&H of Nihilanth was a wonder. And What the Hel(L) was a marvel. Keep up the job of making people smile.     "
pgp31295,Sribatsa Pathy,Dedication,,,"After I met you, Good things come in small packages sounds apt to me. The parties we had in our Mumbai house, Lucknow and random discussions had left me with a lot of memories to cherish. I hope you would become a great stand-up comedian too. #Initiative taker #standup comedy #8pack gymson #roommate     "
pgp31295,Sribatsa Pathy,Humerous,Mature,Confident,"I have really enjoyed the moments we have shared together at HeLL. I am fond of your sense of humor and probably that is the reason whenever I remember you, I remember your smiling face and that makes me smile too. You are the person who brings smile to people face and that's a hell of a thing to do. We might not have the quantity of time but we do have the quality of time together to look back. 

We have had some serious discussion also and I learned that part of yours too. I will look forward to meet you, whenever, wherever and repeat all such things again and again and again!! :D "

You've been an awesome classmate & friend and of course my swimming & walking pardner! Your sketches are insightful and highly observant and you deserve a bigger canvas to paint your Mona Lisa! You're one of a kind & I'm sure we'll laugh at this stupid testimonial 20 years hence :) Much love, Ojas!               "
pgp31295,Sribatsa Pathy,Humurous,,," We shared the last bench for 1 year in Section E. My first impression of meeting you - How can this kid get into a PG program. Second thoughts - Okay then might be a fresher.
But all notions were wrong. This guy is (one of) the best Standup comedian atleast whom I have listened to. You are filled with fun - exploring every oppportunity of humour.
I remember every time you have asked for the best ppt themes. Hope you have become smarter with this youself. In most of my cherishable moments of our PGP1 no doubt you were an integral part. "
pgp31295,Sribatsa Pathy,Body,Actor,Competitive,Tujhse mein thoda late mila tha. But ek barr milne ke baad bahut sahi laga tu. Dil ka bahut saff hai yaar tu. Teri wajah se saare competition jeete hai. Motivation ki kami nai hai tujh mein. Tere sath ladkiyo ki baat karne mein toh bahut hee maje aate hai. SDM class mein Taara wali bate toh bahut sahi thi. WO toh hamesha yaad rahengi. Teri wajah se class ka mahaul tha. 'Mahaul was such'. Tere liye DU ki ladkiyo ki line lagi hai bahar. Ek barr nikal toh sahi.

pgp31295 ,Sribatsa Pathy,SriB,,,We connected over writing (some Forty-Two ka competition it was) and now I know that your amazing words have indeed won many hearts since long. You are one of the people I can express my opinions to without feeling that I'm being judged. It's such a breath of fresh air to have people who speak their hearts and minds around me. We've had fun times…especially when I've taught you about wines :P It's been wonderful knowing you :)           
pgp31296,Swati Arya,randomMetFriend,,,"The random meeting that made our friendship was the start to know a person with a heart. Nothing embellished but its all vanilla plain that you are a good good friend of mine. Not denying the fact that we spent a lot less time here on campus, but you are the most frank, crisp and clear friend whose sarcastic one liners I am fan of. It was great meeting you, and wish we still would be meeting in future.    "

Keep in touch and all the best for your future :)              "
pgp31296,Swati Arya,brilliant,coding,Heart,There is no wonderful story to tell how i met her. Unfortunately(for her) i was to sit next to her for our PGP1. Here i was chattering away non-stop making fun of people and there next to me was a person who spoke 1 word in 1 hour. Dosti to ho hi nahi sakti thi. But then you cant let a person like her go... a person with a good heart. If i had to shell out a nickle for every time she nudged me or Utsav to wake up as we drifted off to sleepcity in class i would go bankrupt. She has mad coding skills and an almost 100% interview conversion rate but no ego which should have come naturally. A constant pillar of support at times when even i had doubts over myself. If i was having a bad day all i need to do is talk to her and she would say something which would make me forget everything else. Its the genuineness in her which makes all the difference. In a place like IIM where everyone is holding a knife to everyone else's neck in the name of competition ready to slit their throats at the drop of a hat it is very refreshing to come across such people. Please stay that way. And please do hire me if you get selected in Google.      
pgp31297,Utsav Kumar,Smooth-talker,,,"Utsav. Meeting you 2 years ago at the first CC get together, you're one person I never thought I could be good friends with. I couldn't have been more wrong. You're someone who can cheer me up no matter what. From waking you up at 4am to calling/texting you in Europe to rant, you've always been there. You're solely responsible for me having multiple nick-names. You've ruined uncountable number of my pics and I hate you for that. From staying up till 6am because I wanted to talk to patiently listening to me rant about something/someone, you are one of my favourites :)       "

You teach us how to party, be game for every plan and take a chill-pill no matter what. I will always remember your classic expressions!  The one when you received the unexpected call at Secret Barn or when Visa and I came to take over your place and you said ""Sone do naa"" or when you unintentionally photo-bomb every regular photo with your regular self. You are the reason to so many laughs we all have had. Thanks dude!    "
pgp31297,Utsav Kumar,Chota-Google,,,"In so many years that I have known you, you have so stubbornly stuck to your old habits! I don't think you have changed one bit. You still make 5-year plans in the era of Tinder, refuse to eat baingan in Italy/ Greece (major part of cuisine) and insist on drinking every Friday evening. I am sure I will meet you 5 years from now and you will still be searching for extra masala to sprinkle on your Maggi and mixing Thumbs up to your single malt.            "

His various efforts to develop apps to make things easier for the Hellites are appreciable. He is a very simple and kind person who doesn't take any offense of other people's jokes and laugh wholeheartedly. With the amount of dedication you put in your work is a sure sign that you are a good team person. Wishing you all the very best.                         "
pgp31298,Vikas Deshmane,god-level,hardworking,earnest,"If i need someone tomorrow to get me out of a pickle it would be this man. An ardent fan of Marathi with ""Jai Maharashtra"" at the tip of his tongue. Notorious for starting marathi conversations on section group and arguing with highly questionable logic. But he is also one of the most reliable people i know on campus. I have made fun of him more number of times than there were stars in the milky way but everytime i have been greeted with a smile. If i was asked to select a man who could code with my life at stake then i would choose him hands down. Such are his mad coding skills. He gave Hellcopter to Hellites, Disha app to team Disha and GATE/CAT prep material to the rest of the world. And he has hardly asked anything in return. Maybe at this time i can give nothing more than "" Thank you for everything"". Keep coding and stay happy  "

He laughs with childish innocence and always tries back to pull your leg. Tough he never succeeded in doing that and time and again become the center of the joke. :P He is a very studious student but sometimes takes tension very easily.

pgp31299,VINAY YADAV,fresher,mercurial,passionate,"After our first conversation, i would have never guessed that i was talking to one of the youngest guys in the campus. The level of maturity with which you spoke was way beyond your years(even mine to be honest). Finance karne ka bahut man hai lekin soch raha hoon marketing kar loon. Being the last guy in our row i hardly had occasion to talk except for ""paper pass kar"". Out of nowhere this 20 year old SRCC guy asks me ""MV ke marketing event main part lega"". I say yes and after a series of unfortunate events a very unlikely team is formed which forms a major part of my CV. In the barrage of events that i took part with him i realised that he was one of the most aspirational, passionate and hard working guys i had come across. TBLA ka campus round bas tere wajah se ho paya. Yeh college yeh placement yeh sab moh maaya hai. You are made for bigger things. Never forget that. And keep moving ahead, keep aspiring for more   "
pgp31300,Vineela Rao Chukkala,VC,,,"VC you are one of the few people on campus who were my family away from home! The countless hours spent in Panel Room 2, discussing single topic for hours, creating a consensus at 4 AM when most of the college is fast asleep and running summers and finals process were some of the most cherished memories I had on campus with you. Last 2 years were a roller coaster of emotions which taught me how people from completely different backgrounds like us can come together and perform a task to near perfection if they believe and stand with each other as mentioned in the Three Musketeers film ""All for one and one for all"". I know our friendship ki picture abhi baaki hai mere dost.. looking forward to more pcom get together with you after HELL :)  "
pgp31300,Vineela Rao Chukkala,Special,strong,,"The first time I met you was during the P com selection process. And from that time only I started admiring you. You have a great personality (literally :D). You are born to an entrepreneur and I hope you get to do it soon. You are fun, loyal and a lovely friend. At times I do find your way of thinking too practical and contrasting to mine but then I wouldn't want it any other way. The times spent with you were all soooo special. Our dancing together in first year, our cold wars, our reconciliation, our Head2Toe adventure and our laughing sessions. I will remember them till the end of the time my amigo. And now you are in Amazon and most probably in Hyderabad. So hoping to see you at work soon and form many more memories in future. 
Believe me this was the most difficult testimonial that I had to write. I am not sure I was able to express the extent to which this friendship means to me, lets just say words fall short (as you said in the mess ). Thank you for being my friend and best of luck for the future.  
           "
pgp31300,Vineela Rao Chukkala,confident,logical,caring," She inspires me for the confidence she has. When she speaks everybody listens because of her confidence and logic. This confidence sometimes misportrays her as rude but she is a very caring person although she refuses to show that. People find it difficult to gel with her but she is a great person to have in life whether as a friend, a mentor or anything. She will never give an advice which is not worth it, she will always have a logic ready behind it. I can never forget that I met a person like her in my life.       "

Vineela, you're smart, pretty and one of the most confident people I know. Right from random conversations to meaningful ones, you've been amazing company! One of very few people from hell that I both love and respect, I haven't the slightest doubt that you'll make it BIG!

The numerous times you have given me life gyan have become an important part of my memory - something I will remember always, even after having left IIM L. Your 'wild' sense of humour gave me some amazing laughter moments. Even watching you laugh (in your typical style) itself made me guffaw. I love taking fashion advice from you (even if it makes me coy!) I like how you strong minded you are. You are not afraid to speak your mind. You are not afraid to try new things. In the politically correct society of ours, this is one quality I truly admire in you.  I have a great deal of respect for you. I hope we stay friends forever. :)   "

The dude knows his 'angles' in the 'right' way, and one can always be sure that with Dewa around,there would ample doses on sudden sentiyapa and amazing photos to remember it all :D Always the one to stand by friends in any situation, he would go out of his way to help those he cared about.

pgp31302,Dewansh Zanwar,Dewa,,," You already know, no words can describe how greatful I am to this place, that it introduced us. If ever in my entire life I will think about IIML, you will be the first person who will cross my mind. We have so many things, that this space is too small. Numerous competitions, fights, projects and several outings or generally wasting time, we have literally done it all here. Here's to you, you are an amazing person and your personality is very unique to you. Always stay that way. You have literally stood with me through my thicks and thins. I am very greatful to you for being the amazing friend. Here's my word to you, no friendship or any relaionship for that matter will replace this ever. I never thought I will meet anybody who is as amazing as you are, atlest in post graduation, but you buddy, you defied it all. It was a roller coaster ride with you, because we have pulled off some very silly things too. I know whenever we will go down the memory lane, we will always find one- another there. Be happy always.     "

pgp31302,Dewansh Zanwar,Entrepreneurial,Creative,Trustworthy," The way you go about working on everything is inspiring. You work on 10 major things at once and still making progress in all.

Wish you all the success bro!!    "
pgp31302,Dewansh Zanwar,Zanwar,Dewa,,"Sitting back to back in class has given us an opportunity to pull each other's leg for a year.

Plus every example that was around your two years workex in supply chain. But on a serious note, you are an amazing person, a great photographer (who capture the best peacocks for me), a true friend and a good writer.

pgp31302,Dewansh Zanwar,Inventive,Caring,,"The 'Senti' King of our ""Sanki"" Group and probably the most sorted and talented guy. The only thing I remember from our first meeting is your long hair, Indori love and our distant friends-connection (If you know what I mean :P ). As I am writing this, I can distinctively recall all your multi-line, difficult to interpret, Hinglish cum Hindi WhatsApp messages. Frankly speaking, I still struggle to decode most of them. All things aside, Dewa, your journey has been an inspiration to many of us. I really admire the fact that unlike most of us, you are always very clear about what do you want to do with your life. I wish you all the very best. May you achieve everything you desire in life. ""Keep shinning and don't rush because sometimes it's okay to sit back and relax""                            "
pgp31302,Dewansh Zanwar,Sentiman,Photographer,,"Day -2 friend.. You are a born senti leader. Initially, I used to wonder what kind of creature you are but when I closely came to know you that you are that person who follows his dreams. Your to do list in your room always inspired me to go out and try new things. The friendship carried me away from my shelter home in H8 to H13 so that we can be nearer and discuss many trips to come. Meri shadi ke liye tujhe hi bulaunga pre-wedding shoot ke liye :P          "
pgp31302,Dewansh Zanwar,Softhearted,Hard-working,," I did not get the opportunity to know you ache se.. but with whatever interactions we had, you seem to be a stand up guy.

pgp31302,Dewansh Zanwar,DedicatedBanda,AmazingPerson,,One of the few person whom I admire very much for his dedication and hardwork. The amount of effort this guy could put into anything is extremely remarkable. He completely changed my perception of chasing ones dreams and his super supportive attitude is highly appreciative. His sincerity towards learning new things and always ready to help behavior makes him a great friend and good human being.   
pgp31302,Dewansh Zanwar,Dewa,SentiMan,FilthBenchmark,"Dewa re Dewa :)
You're my family. I know there are times when we both don't agree with each other or don't understand each other that well. But at the end of the day we know we'll always be there for each other. And that's what makes you so special and my strongest support system here.
Whenever things go beyond my reach or I cannot deal with them, you know you are the first person I reach to. I don't think anyone has seen me cry as many times as you. :P But frankly, this has got me thinking that probably I did not come to you during the high points and I'm actually sorry for that. I was lucky to have you by my side and frankly I wouldn't have most of the friends I have here, if it wasn't for you. 
You are one of the most hard-working persons I know. It wouldn't be a surprise if in the coming years, I see you as running your own business.
I very clearly remember, when my Nani expired, you were my whole family that day. I don't think I say this as often as I should, despite all our arguments, please know that I respect you and love you with all my heart.   "
pgp31302,Dewansh Zanwar,Senti,Dewa,," It was Dewansh that helped me coin the term 'sentiyapa' and earned himself the crown of 'Senti-Singh'. He played a pivotal role in making the current friends circle even before joining IIML. What is often termed as overtly 'senti' often helped in accelerating the bonds among friends that we cherish today. From compelling people to meet up to sending insanely long messages, this guy has done it all. He has been probably the most avid photography fan on campus and has chased peacocks and other birds so much that they wanted to sue him for stalking. Surprisingly, he can paint too and you will be amazed at some of his creations.  While staying vocal in public, he ensures that he communicates privately too. It is through these chats that you realise that he will be there for you, no matter what. If you are looking for someone regarding corporate events/ case studies/ live projects this guy is a one stop shop and has done more projects than anyone else across B Schools.  Fun Fact. He has more white boards in his room than a typical Stationery Shop.  Survival Tip: Don't let him get emotional about anything while you are near him. Song Dedication: Allah k bande hasde! "
pgp31302,Dewansh Zanwar,Janwar!,,,"From involving Divya in conversation when she came on campus, to checking up on me before placements or for doctor, I can totally see your concern for your friends. I loved talking to your parents ! It's one special memory I have of this campus ! Would totally want to meet them again ! You came on campus with a few set goals, and I feel you did everything in your power to achieve them. Few end up doing that. All the best, stay in touch ! "
pgp31302 ,Dewansh Zanwar,Photoshooter,l,l,"Hi Dewansh, we became friends almost at the end of the two years (thanks for the wonderful photoshoot) but today I am sure that this friendship will now last a lifetime :) You are a very wonderful person and one of the very few genuine persons on campus.try to make as many people smile as you can! Wish you all the very best and stay in touch! :)       "
pgp31303,Abhishek Paul,Awesome,Humble,Kind," Ever ready to help, the silent types but the most fun types. Smarty pants Paul and the most unpresuming, I'm unapologetically a fan of his humbleness. I could clear my QAM 3 test with flying colors just because of you. Many thanks for having the patience to help a mathematically challenged person like me and enabling me to pass that test. You are awesome!                          "

As time proceeded, I came to realise how wonderful person you are to spend time with! There were those amazing match moments and then there were the tutorials, but beyond that your wits had us in fits many a time and that I will long remember! You epitomize the word 'Stud'. It has been a great experience seeing you silently keep on doing what you do best! See you again fellow warrior! Tata has a Gem with them. Hope you shine bright, always Paul.                                                              "

Take care dude and All the best for everything ahead.                                                          "

But that is how talks have always been with you - Jargon laced but amazingly interested! Those dancing evenings were splendid and I think those will be one of the things I will miss more about Lucknow that most of the other things. Thanks for all the patience with the pathetic jokes and idiotic moments. All the best ahead my friend, be it Gurgaon, Bengaluru or any other part of the world.   "
pgp31305,Aditya Sardana,Banana,,,"With all the 'Fresher' traits, Sardana has definitely been the cutest, most humble and the most fattu person I've met on campus. He has this perfect appetite of 2 rotis after eating 6 already! A fitness freak, Sardana can always burn calories by just thinking about it!
With confidence levels hovering close to America's interest rates, Aditya just needs a 10 minute prep to pull off a 30-second conversation with the 'dhobi'. He is also one of the laziest persons in the world, spending 16 hours sleeping every day and taking a shower once every week! His unconditional love towards food, sleep and Aman Gupta brings tears to eyes.
I've always been jealous to see him as the most talented person in the group. He plays guitar, keyboard, badminton, and cricket, is in the swimming team, is a chess champion and dances really well (Subhaan Allah!). He is also a diversity in himself. He might be the only Punjabi alive to have a Bhojpuri accent and to live in Chennai.
He is always up for random discussions, tries his best to look concerned, and is the most useless best-friend I've made here! Macha, I just love the way yu say, ""Machaaaaaa…."" Looking forward to meeting you in Bangalore (on weekends only)

pgp31305,Aditya Sardana,Bun,,,Hello Bun...  I always feel that your gang has given a appropriate name..pluffy pluffy... It suits very well... I admire you very much for your sincerity. Be the way you are. All the very best for your future endeavors..    
pgp31305,Aditya Sardana,Bun,,,"It's crazy how talented this guy is. There are very few things he can't do. The ones he can't he picks up quickly. Except for learning how to talk because he's a silent (:P) person. Also, a big foodie. No one loves their food like this guy does.
But why're you so sad, Bun? I wish over time the occasions to ask you this had lessened. Hope they do in the future. Thanks for the good times, friend :)"

pgp31306,Aman Goel,Disciplined,Explorer,,"Aman is the only reason I shed those 8kgs during last few months of stay at campus. I remember how you used to wake me up daily for the gym and even used to train me during gym. Where were you in first year my friend :D? And how can I not thanks you for visiting so many awesome places to eat in Lucknow. Had you not been there, I think I might not have even know about 80% of them. Now who will motivate me to go to gym in future. I am surely gonna miss you everytime I weight myself and see a tip up there.      "

pgp31306,Aman Goel,Eatery_Planner,,,"He claims to have sorted memory due to his ability to forget things easily. But I'll advise you to consult him if you are planning to eat something outside, he won't need to recall even once to inform you where you should go. He is better than Zomato sometimes. Let me save some space here, he must be getting lots of testimonials :-)          "
pgp31306,Aman Goel,seedha,,,We became good friends over time. I had a notion that extremely smart guys here at IIM-L usually have an air about them but you proved to be an exception - your are humbly grounded while acing what not. I adore your love for food and your zeal for travelling and exploring. I want to have your patience and level-headedness. You take everyone together and have a caring attitude. I'm sure you will make it big - all the very best.

pgp31306,Aman Goel,Brother,Helping,Caring,"Ok, where do I start? I still feel happy knowing you were there, despite the fact that I could be of no value whatsoever. I am so happy we got to share the section, making it an amazing coincidence after Kota But I do regret we never did projects together, nor could spend some good time given our extraordinary past. Sad that when the chance could have been there, I stand on the cusp of leaving. Maybe that is how it was meant to be! You didn't come for exchange and unfortunately we couldn't make up for the lost time there. But then again, the bike journeys and some special trips with you remain cherished, as does every moment that we have spent together. You are the coolness in DATA and such a great person! Thank you for everything brother. Needless to say, I am 100% sure of us meeting again in NCR and cheering out loud to life! Loads of love darling.                                           "

Seriously, it would have been impossible for me to pass any Fin subject them without your help. Thank you so much for bearing with me. I value our friendship and know that you would be there for me if ever I need you. Wish you all the best for future. Stay connected.     "

Our mutual friend is now a very good friend of mine. Thanks! And when you mentioned her to me in 1st year, is how our friendship started. Bakar, movies & the study sessions were simply fun. I always could turn to you for any help or advice & you always had my back. Thanks for the amazing new places that you took for exploring the city. You share the same love for desserts as me and some of the places had delicious desserts! Thank you being a super awesome friend. You are a very calm person & never got angry despite my non-stop chatter :D. Friends Forever. Cheers, Tanvi                     "
pgp31307,AMIT VARSHNEY,Phodu,,," Amit and I had our seats next to each other for the 1st year in section F, and I think that's how we became friends. Plus we had our rooms in the same hostel. He is the greatest combination of intelligence and fun I have ever met…well among top 10 IRs and partying almost every day (those who know about Hostel 8 parties can relate). He loves to tease people, but is very helpful; has taught us many subjects for exams and even during placements (famous for crash courses). It has been great to have met you Amit."
pgp31307,AMIT VARSHNEY,Sir,,,"There are few who garner instant respect - you lead that league. You have redefined the definition of IR here at IIM-L. What sense of humour, what humility, what studdapa - it has been an honour to know you. Waiting to read about you in the news soon, all the very best.              "
pgp31307,AMIT VARSHNEY,Fodu,,,"From the first day in class when I asked him ""have we met before?"", He has been my best friend on campus. Be it late night chai in the mess or random discussions or multiple competitions, we have been integral part of each other's life in Lucknow. He is not only academically brilliant but one of the most grounded and helpful people on campus. A permanent night mess companion, we have increased the chai consumption of mess significantly :D. I am sure this will be a life long friendship.  "
pgp31307,AMIT VARSHNEY,Exuberant,Witty,Sharp,"Being diagonally opposite as personalities leads to generally very high bonding or none whatsoever. Ours has been the later. But despite evr hardly had time together, I guess we leave IIM with some funny, uniques memories to share. People like you have always left me in an awe, maybe that's why we never really had a chance to talk much. Being the Brains of DATA, your quality and brilliance has never been a question.Your understanding of people and situations is the thing which has left me more fascinated and impressed. I guess success awaits you on the other side of Lucknow, the same way you found here at IIM Lucknow. Not much to say, but I hope you excel at everything you do and that life treats you kindly, always. Good luck for life and everything else that comes your way.      "
pgp31307,AMIT VARSHNEY,Phodu,,,"Topper, Phodu, Teacher's pet (nightmare), Psycho-analyst, Daring, Caring are the words that describe you.

How many secrets have you kept! Share them… & not everything works as per the psychology you think :D Anyways, I can never forget the study session (for BIO) in CC, when we saw the light of the day :D Aage bhi aise hi machate rehna & khushkhabri dete rehna :P Friends Forever.

You, my friend, are someone who probably sits right at the top of that list. Amazing levels of energy dude! I can't think of an instance where you had a chance to participate and you didn't. Every sport I can think of had your name doing the rounds. It is no wonder that you happen to be the steam engine for many tasks taking around the campus. Thanks for being such a sport always. I personally know how it is to be so outgoing, especially the repercussions of it and how people tend to misinterpret so many of the actions. And hence I personally hope that you find a crowd where you are understood and accepted the way you are and not the way society would want to mold you. Once again, thanks for the lovely memories and good luck for all the endeavors in life. Hope you farewell.               "

pgp31309,Anant Kumar,Peace,,," They shy kid of the gang. The poise and simplicity that you carry is really something to have reference for.  You are an amazing photographer and I used to feel jealous for the praise that you generate, when every time F section people used to say , ""Anant Best hai"".

pgp31309,Anant Kumar,Photographer,,," Anant is my super senior from IIT Kharagpur (not trying to point out your age  :P). In 1st year, the major interaction we used to have was me calling him or going to his room asking for his bike. Then we shifted to same hostel in 2nd year, and since then, we had travelled a lot together. The good pics I have used to change my DPs have been mostly clicked by this great photographer (thank you for the bike and DSLR pics). Anant is one who understand everyone, looks for depth in everything, but tries to be diplomatic in every statement."

Your happy go lucky attitude towards life is infectious. Dude, you have made my life a lot easier and bearable here. I will miss our abstract discussions and gossips. Now that you're an investment banker, I am glad you got what you were passionate about and I am sure you will do really really fantastic in life.

pgp31310,Aniruddha Srivastava,TooGood,Diplomatic,Sophesticated,"Tintin, life with you have always been interesting .We had numerous parties on campus and there are several occasions and memories that I would cherish for life. I could safely say that you were the person that I had most fun with. Ever, wondered why everybody wanted you not to go home? Its because you are such a nice and fun person to hang out with. Always putting others before you. People complain to you about you making excuses, but they know that what they expect from you is beyond what they could reasonably expect from someone else.For me, you were a savior, a freeze breeze in an otherwise toxic environment.I have a lot more to say and I would say that you personally.I hope we continue to hang out together and have fun. I wish you all the best for your future life.    "
pgp31310,Aniruddha Srivastava,Nawaaab,Day-scholar,,"Aniruddha, Can you please solve one mystery for me which I am trying to solve since last 2 years. The mystery goes ""How can Tintin be woken up?"" I mean I have tried all means like gently asking, opening your doors and windows, taking your blanket away, throwing water on your face. But every time you come up with the same excuse, ""2 ghante baad utha doge kya?"" Apart from this, you are the most helpful person at the campus who has never said no to anything anytime. Keep it up, keep helping people and keep being so sober you are. :)   "

pgp31310,Aniruddha Srivastava,Tintin,,," Aniruddha is popularly known as Tintin. He is a localite (Lucknow ka Nawaab), and that's why one would rarely find him in campus. Being a Lucknowite is clearly visible in his personality, and the respect (Tehzeeb) with which he talks. Blame him for anything, and he will have spontaneous excuse ready for everything (which changes everytime he is asked). If anyone gets a chance, they should watch his Robot dance on the song ""main aisa kyun hoon"" (:P :P)."
pgp31310,Aniruddha Srivastava,Tintin_Koothrappali,,,"Talk about the 'The adventures of Tintin' and Aniruddha will not disappoint you anytime. He is always after the corrupt places in Lucknow and is never afraid to drive at his own peril to reach there, just to inspect the places personally. This is not only his looks but also the characteristics that resemble with Tintin. Like the true character, he also cares for everyone, be it strangers or a friend. Being compassionate, caring and 'Type-A' personality comes naturally to him. And lastly, if he wouldn't be smart, he wouldn't have been Tintin after all. Man, people will first narrate about you, then you will become a story and then a legend. Way to go, dude, I'm following you :-)    "

pgp31310,Aniruddha Srivastava,Dayscholar,,,"Guy with the excuses. He has excuse ready for everything on tip of his tongue. Every person has something to die for , for him it is chicken and *******. Though IIM Lucknow is residential campus but he is hardly found in campus. But he is always there to help you when needed (only advice in short globe). He is the best globe master. He can make you travel the entire world, even if he has never even heard the name of the place. Part of Bhavisya but his one is always in doubt. Family is everything for him, that is the reason in this hectic schedule where one hardly found time to sleep, he travels twice for home everyday.         "

From planning all of our outings meticulously to caring about each and every one of us like an elder brother, there cannot be another person like you. Our late night mess musings will always be something to be treasured. You are an out an out *neat guy* :p.. The most ziddi person, you do not back down unless your victim has been thoroughly influenced.  We've had such random bike trips in search of food and the quintessential pav-bhaji.

You are now one of the reasons why I did not want to leave this place. I survived here because of you. If it was not for you I would had never been able to have my breakfast, had skip most morning classes, missed quizzes and had flunk in couple of subjects. You were there during my panic attacks, when most happy, while crying my heart out, when grumpy and every single time I needed you. You are my bestest friend but more than that you are a wonderful human being, most sincere and genuine person I have ever met. I have seen you caring for every single person you know of. I am glad to have you. I will remember our all night conversations, walks around the campus, visiting every single place in Lucknow, our love for food, grocery shopping, watching movies together and laughing out insane, everything. I will remember how you troubled me whenever you got all grumpy and stubborn. You made these two years so much easy and fun for me. I can't thank you enough but thank you for being there for me in my best and in my worst. Thank you for sharing my craziness and bearing my weirdness. I will miss you the most Aebin!          "
pgp31312,Avin Chanana,Panda,Shama,, Bro you are as lazy as Panda. Get a girl bro!  
pgp31312,Avin Chanana,Captain,Humble,Methodical,"One of the few people I always have respected, right from the beginning! Maybe I never showed that enough, but that has been the case! You are a great person, and I shall never forget the invincible of Section F and its inspirational captain! Thank you for leading the best defence and making us all proud! More than that, thank you for your friendship, I, for once could drop my usual criticizing, cynical, skeptical self and know that if nothing pressing came, I could always count on you for help! And then I don't know what to say or make of Mumbai. Some of the best evenings in India have been spent in your company and courtesy you. The memories will always stay. Even as many more will add on as we travel together more. Thank you Avin, for everything I might have failed to recognize or appreciate. You will rock the company(s) you will work for and I look forward to all those glorious stories.                                           "
pgp31312,Avin Chanana,GoluMolu,,,"Chanana, you are very cute, in all your ways. It has always been fun with you. The farmhouse, campus parties and Ops study together can never be forgotten. But more than anything it is a pleasure to a know a person with such a good-heart! "
pgp31312,Avin Chanana,Pappa,,,"""The Mattress King"" is what comes to my mind when I remember him! No, not the one from F.R.I.E.N.D.S., he is the very king of his own mattress incident!..:P. I guess I have made him remember enough, so I wouldn't say much more about it. He is one of the ever-caring people I have ever come across, and of course that is why we named him Pappa. A wonderful person, crazily hardworking (whenever he works, that is!), we have spent some amazing times during these two years. Parties, studies, CV preparations, bike rides around the campus singing on top of our voices, pizzas, movies (where he literally had to stop me from not eating another big bucket of caramel popcorn!), oh, and how could I forget, the tasks during clubs/committees formation. And gosh, the times in the library during our first two weeks in college, laughing madly over trivial things, the ""family"" had some real fun times. So here's me wishing you loads of good luck wherever you are, in whatever you do, and remember, whenever you get clicked, do it with a Pappa Pout!..:P "
pgp31312 ,Avin Chanana,Amazing,Loving,,"You are one person with so much more experience and maturity than me and that reflects in our interactions. You are definitely one of the most down-to-earth people and have always been so, so, so nice to me. :)    "
pgp31313,Balkrishna Kesarkar,Balu,Aalsi,, You were the best friend any1 could have asked for. The memories which I have with you are epic. I've always been jealous of your qualities and accomplishments. Like your ability to approach a girl and flirt so fluently. Or your time management scheme and having a power nap of just 5 mins. Pyase ko panic pilana punya ka kaam hota hai ye maine aapse sikha. The best thing is that you are from Goa. You were on your best when you planned a trip to Goa and gave us best tour we could have ever had. I hope you never change and keep enlightening poor lads like us.  
pgp31313,Balkrishna Kesarkar,Globemaster,,,"Globemaster! Cannot forget the MIS project we did together, the crappiest project presentation where you summarized everyone's part and called it your own and others standing in the background trying hard not to laugh. No idea how we got the highest marks in that. Have to accept you are a Globemaster!   "
pgp31313,Balkrishna Kesarkar,Sleeping,,," Balu, I really enjoyed teaching u; itna satisfaction milta h na tujhe padhakr because otherwise I know you will not study. We took various subjects together but sections ne dhoka de diya. It is fun talking , listening to your globe (maarna mat),campaigning, partying and dancing and just being with you. You are the one who fulfilled my two desires- one is of getting me paan and second that of bike ride. Bas, thoda kam soya kar and keep smiling.                                    "
pgp31313,Balkrishna Kesarkar,ConMan,,," Unfortunately, I was introduced to your sense of humour quite late in the day, but it is damn wicked I must say. Your assessment of one of the ""the"" couples of our campus was outright hilarious. Sloshed Balu singing a love song is the creepiest thing anybody can see (the video is proof). Also, though I have not seen the Kabir Khan  at work in volleyball, I have heard many things and can imagine what a laugh riot it must be. I have also seen your ""mastery"" at darts. Nobody nails it like you do.  "
pgp31313,Balkrishna Kesarkar,Conman,,, You can be one sexy dude.. you have it all going for you :p A real nice person to be with and someone I know we can count upon. Always stay the same :)
pgp31313,Balkrishna Kesarkar,Balua,Bhalu,Balu,"IIML ka Balua very very hot haye meri tauba tauba. Balua you are like the hot combination of sexy, hot and caring. Your messed up hair, dark eyes and that stern look takes every girl's breath away. More importantly you look adorable when you laugh, Kissss Meee, Close your eyes. Miss Mee. We have had awesome parties together and looking forward to more insane ones. Love you balu.          "
pgp31313,Balkrishna Kesarkar,Enthusiastic,Enigmatic,,"A famous poem says ""The people next to you… are the greatest miracles you will ever meet"". Balkrishna, the person sitting next to me for the entire PGP1, is not the miracle you hoped for (Well may be a little :P). But he is unique and delightful in his own little ways. Popular by a variety of names- Balu, Bala, Kesarkar, Balkrishna, Siddhesh- to mention a few. It is in perfectly in sync with the diverse character he is. A difficult person to read (which makes him a great Poker player too). He was my accomplice during most of my in-class mischiefs- eating food secretly, playing book games, watching YouTube videos with prof right in front and quite a few others. The most memorable day we share is the bike trip to Nepalgunj. An extraordinary pillion riding capabilities he showed that day :P.    "
pgp31313,Balkrishna Kesarkar,Chava,Always,Aashique,"Tequila style vodka shots! The last day of Term 2. The first day of classes in term 1, section group maker! I will remember you for things far greater :D Never got to speak Badu correctly though. Mast you are dude! Stay the same! Have tons of fun ahead! All the best bro. Do great in life.                                               "
pgp31313,Balkrishna Kesarkar,Balu,-,-," Your 'never out of place' hair, your 'ever so energetic' attitude in life, your disability to 'globe' on any subject matter and your 'I can get any girl' talent can never be forgotten! And your 'Paani sungh lena' trick is just out of the world! With being from goa as your USP, you have been the trip planner for all of us. But more than that, you have been the greatest friend one could ask for. You have stood by me, looked out for me and heard my endless ranting all the time. But Balu has just one problem which I am sure will stay. Balu se na ho payega! PS: I will never forgive you for the salty water fiasco.    "
pgp31313,Balkrishna Kesarkar,Balu,,,He always had his eye on my cold coffee :P not that I minded sharing some with him. He always seems to be in state of sleepiness with his tousled hair and drowsy eyes. Talks like a gunda at times :P
pgp31313,Balkrishna Kesarkar,Balu,Balua,,"""Lucknow Ka Balua very very hot. Haye Meri tauba tauba"" I know you are not fond of it but I just had to do it. Hahah. But then you have always let us do whatever we feel like. That one person in the group who spoils us and pampers us. Balu you are a gem who would take up all responsibilities, silliest jokes and the party planning on himself without twitching. I love how that small smile never fades away in the most tiring of the times. My favourite boy in pink shirt. Trust me no one can pull those shirts better than you. The rules that your friendship taught us. We don't mess when Balu is sleeping and ""fun Karne Ka adventure Nahi karne Ka"". Be the same calm and cool self that you are. Love.        "
pgp31313,Balkrishna Kesarkar,Balu,,,"Balu!! You look high sometimes when you aren't even high! :D anyways, you are a helpful & caring guy. Never said no when I asked for help. Alag hi calm & swag nature hain tera. Stay in touch. All the best. Cheers, Tanvi           "
pgp31313 ,Balkrishna Kesarkar,Lazy,Chava,,Chava No. 4 is the funniest person I know. Your actions and dialogues *pani lekar aa* etc will always make me laugh. You hold the group together. If not for you we would not have so many parties. So many amazing memories. Camaraderie and Sangram mai machaya tha launde ne. Your hairstyle is awesome :D Thailand mai mazze karenge. All the best for the future :)    
pgp31314,Chandan Kumar,Mashup_of_Stubbornness_&_Robustness,,, Abey I was your wing mate throughout the course and you surprised me with your stubbornness every single time......all the best for your future endeavors                              
pgp31314,Chandan Kumar,Gurudev,,,"Well, words fall short when your prowess has to be described - God level might do justice to some extent. You have always approached things from the very fundamentals and have built upon that. Whosoever used to come to me for some suggestion upon financial matters, I have always directed them to you (undoubtedly) and they all end in awe of you. I admire your discipline and rigor. I am sure you will go on to become the head of some financial institution soon in life and we will get to read your expert opinions in the news. Wishing you all the very best for a fantastic future.     "
pgp31315,CHARMY PANIGRAHI,Beautiful,chirpy,Sweet, So sweet and caring this girl is. thanks for teaching me during Finals. Love you.    
pgp31315,CHARMY PANIGRAHI,PhotographicMemory,,,"Charmy – 99.9 percentiler, I seriously admire (sometimes envy also) how you can multitask and how you can stay up the entire night chatting and attend classes the next day. How you can read Harry Potter before exam. And how you turn sane people into mobile game addicts. I can count the casualties you have caused. You are cute and adorable, Charmy. Always be as you are. Teri wajah se ab mein bhi tez bolne lagi hu. Btw it has helped me. Thanks.  "
pgp31315,CHARMY PANIGRAHI,Crazy,Super,Lovable,"My awesome neighbour, thanks for always being there, you are cutest and smartest in so many ways, like all the goodness saved in a little packet. I wish when you see yourself in the mirror of erised, you see yourself exactly as you are :D "
pgp31315,CHARMY PANIGRAHI,bubbly,,,"  It's a lot of fun interacting with Charmy because she has the guts not to mince words and the truth is funny sometimes!!On a serious note,she is a dear friend who would listen patiently to all that I had to say and would always give me practical solutions and suggestions!!I'm in awe of her eidetic memory thanks to which she knows even the trivials details of a shot in a movie or a page in some book that she read.yes..she is a bibliophile and a movie/TV series buff!!Was lucky to go out with you on multiple occasions.What fun it was no!!I love the way you shout out my name in the mess sometimes and then come and give me a bear hug.Awwwww that is so sweet:)May God bless you with happiness and success in abundance:)"
pgp31315,CHARMY PANIGRAHI,Charmayi,MoviesEncyclopedia,Fraudnonveg,"Stud hai tu. I think you are super brainy and you have a huge memory. Tujhe itni cheezein kaise yaad rehti hai! you are super fun, maza ata hai tere sath gappe marne me aur youtube videos dekhne :D I like the way you care about people around you.

pgp31315,CHARMY PANIGRAHI,fun,,," You are an amazing person Charmy, you have your own charm. I wish I had been good friends with you even in the undergraduate college times.  "
pgp31315,CHARMY PANIGRAHI,TalkingStation,,," Listening to you is one thing that one can do while with you. The time at Lucknow became bearable because of your constant chatter. Always being cheerful and cheering everyone around you even in such a tense environment will always be cherished by me. Time in Bombay during internship was great due to your stories ""25 hrs a day"" about Bangalore.  Be happy & cheery & spread it to people with you.   "
pgp31315,CHARMY PANIGRAHI,Loudspeaker,gamefreak,,"First night-out friend, starting from induction group task which turned into default group partner. U  clarify your name on the first go itself for people on the basis of enough experiences that people will not be able to comprehend it :P No need to say ur voice can echo in the entire mess. Stop getting irritated over food and eat something :P All the best for future :)      "
pgp31315,CHARMY PANIGRAHI,Charming,Silent,Sleeper,"Charmyyy! Charm me! Damn, I will miss disturbing you in between classes! You talked so much about Vidhu at times, it felt scary that what you would do once Paris happens! Do good re! I hope your stealth gaming goes on! It was a refreshing booster when I myself would sit terrified! Take care dost! All the best for everything that comes your way henceforth.                                           "

pgp31317,DEEPANSHU BARUA,Panda,,,"I am glad that I joined remeds, for I met so many people there, you being one of them - Deepa from remeds! I really enjoyed the time I spent in 13 with you (also 'coz you don't leave 13 to go elsewhere) and all the outings we had. And parties with you were crazy (you know why :P). I like the sincerity you have (seriously) and the amazing bundle of knowledge and history gyaan you have. And your sense of humour! Looking forward to staying in touch for years. Be this cool panda version always :D         "
pgp31317,DEEPANSHU BARUA,Panda,,,"Panda.. the complete friend.. party mei saath.. khaane mei saath.. classes mei saath.. bakar mei saath.. I am lucky to have a friend like panda. He has always been a great person to have debates with(read late night bakar :P) despite his low melting point :P  He is an awesome driver to sit behind with :P He cracks the worst PJ in the history of humanity and of course is the only one who laughs at them. He is a very happy person by nature and is always seen smiling, sleeping or hugging :P Needless to say, and I know he will but still be in touch.. Delhi mei to milna hai waise!    "
pgp31317,DEEPANSHU BARUA,Panda,,, Thanks for keeping the wing all fun & full of shenanigans. The UNO & the poker party nights were something which will be cherished for long.      
pgp31317,DEEPANSHU BARUA,Deepa,Panda,Cuto,"You define chilling Panda. I so relate to your hours long naps, heavy midnight munching and ""Light lo"" attitude. I hope you get an Aiyaash life with all luxuries and aaram. Stay the same panda :) Jaipur milte hai ;)    "
pgp31317,DEEPANSHU BARUA,Panda,,,"The cushion! The evening parties were more fun only because of you. From your helmet dance, your phone-a-friend to your toilet hugging parable, you entertained us to the maximum. Without the Panda, life in IIML wouldn't have been this fun. You have this feel-good charm that makes me feel hunky-dory. Also love pulling your leg is one of our indulgence! So deal with it. And your chicken recipe was awesome baba. See you in Medina. "
pgp31317,DEEPANSHU BARUA,Panda,Motu,MonuBhai,"Panda! tera helmet dance!!
Our panda is by far the chillest person I've come across in these two years. He sleeps for twenty hours a day and spends the remaining four eating. When he decides to sleep for an hour or two less, he invests the time in his trademark 'Helmet dance', and of course his 'Monu Bhai' stories.   "
pgp31317 ,DEEPANSHU BARUA,Panda,Sleeping,Happy," Very cheerful person. Panda's one liners are epic and so is the laughter that follows. Bounces on his toes in a seemingly funny manner when he is nervous. Most of the times, he is not bothered about what is happening in the world – likes to live life in chill max mode. Beware not to wake him up while he is sleeping which could be any hour of the day. One is also advised to avoid his room for one's own safety. "
pgp31318,Deepika Yadav,Head,Genuine,,Lets go to Bali and make fabulous memories :) 
pgp31318,Deepika Yadav,,,,
pgp31318,Deepika Yadav,Smiling,Late,Sweet,"You are a person that everybody on the campus can find smiling round the year.Your quintessential smile and your sweet nature has earned you many friends and well wishers in the campus. Since we were a part of the ALCOM for two years, we got a lot of opportunities to interact.Even then surprisingly, I have mostly good things to say about you.The earnestness and honesty was apparent in your work.And nobody ever seemed to mind that you came late by 10 minutes for every get-together we had as a committee.Your gang of friends with whom I interacted were really great and fun to hang out with.Along with all this,what really sets you apart is that you are good person at heart, which surprisingly is a rare quality here.You think about other individuals and go to some lengths to do the right thing.I really wish that you would defeat all odds to fulfill your dreams in your life and life a happy and satisfying life.My best wishes for your future.             "
pgp31318,Deepika Yadav,Studious,No-Party-Girl,,"Deepika, a person always having a smiling face with a fixed width of smile :P. How can you be so consistent in your smile :D? She is a very hard working person and can always be found studying or participating in some competition. She is so studious that a quiz week ahead can make her say no to a party tonight. But she also concerns a lot for her friends and tries to solve their problems, but I am not sure how much of it she applies to herself. I remember your 3-hour long lecture on why and how should I go to prom. But in the end you yourself didn't go. I hope you start applying those advices on your life too so that your life become bit chillax. For now, plan on how do you want to party in Gurgaon, I will come to crash it. :)        "

pgp31318,Deepika Yadav,Deepuu,,," My Delhi companion!!! You have been one of my first friends on campus. We were the latecomers during induction helping each other in misery. :D You have been in almost every project group that I have made. The gossips, the train journeys, the ticket booking frenzies and the last minute ticket confirmations. It has been fun. Luv you!!!       "
pgp31318,Deepika Yadav,Crazy,,,Hey Sweetie..Even after 15-30 years.. I would only remember you by.. how you die for milk.. And of course sweets..I always fantasize about you stealing milk.. But that never happened though..but.. would like to see once ;) You are the one who taught me it is us who has to decide how one should behave/act in any situation.. Kudos to your theory.. Lovve it..You remember our first fight and how it didn't matter and how we got along with each other..I liked it..All our campus walks..our jogging pact..I enjoyed them..You are a person who value the experience with the person rather than the experience itself..That's the reason we enjoyed our random outings.. which always end up with some or the other disappointment..I still remember the faces you made at the health centre.. you looked cute though.. :))    Your Dukhi Aatma                           
pgp31318,Deepika Yadav,Sweet,Silent,Shiny,"Well, I know you will be curious about what made me right the subtext in your name. Well, that is how I have considered all my interactions with you - be it at the football practices, birthdays, section outings and various others. It is good to have someone around who smiles at all jokes, irrespective of however bad they are. Makes everyone feel easy and good about life. Thank you for being one of those persons :D I wish you all the best. I am super super sure that you will do great in life. Stay the same as you are.                                             "
pgp31320,Diwakar Agrawal,Man-of-a-few-words,,,Diwakar is one of the most grounded yet sharp guys that I know of. Always helpful to others. Happy to have know you man! 
pgp31320,Diwakar Agrawal,Serious,Loyal,Sarcastic,"Diwakar, I know there would be a lot of people writing tons of great things about you. So, I'll be brief in your praise and focus on other things. As almost everybody who interacted with you knows that you are a sincere, smart guy who is serious towards his goals in life.However, your close friends also know about your sarcastic quips and your failed attempts at being funny (Called PJs). You were among the first few friends I had on campus but somehow I felt we did not spend enough time together. I must say that I have massive respect for you.Though, you have a lot of shortcomings and definitely not right all the time. However, You are true friend.If I try to summarize my life at IIM L , each would end with you being a key game changer, that helped me through. From the FRA endterm, Summer placements, Singapore interview, during internship or during final placemsnts.It was you who I fell back upon when I was in crisis and you responded almost everytime and most importantly made a difference.I cannot be thankful enough for your efforts. Personally I have not been able to do a fraction of that.I hope you achieve all you desire in life and wish you all the best for your future.           "
pgp31320,Diwakar Agrawal,Jolly,,,"You are one person who has the ability to be Calm and funny even in the most stressful situation when I panic like anything, who has the solution to almost all my problems and who can have a conversation while looking at his phone all the time :P. Behind this sincere and nerdy looking man is a jovial person who cracks the most unfunny jokes (but they make you laugh anyway), a person who is always ready to help his friends and comes up with most spontaneous answers. One of the most honest people I have met (sometimes a little too much :P) and I really respect you for that. Thank you for always being there for me.     "
pgp31320,Diwakar Agrawal,Mysterious,,,"Diwakar, a person whom I became friends even before coming to campus, is one of the most deserving candidates at IIML. You are a golden-hearted person and people aspire to meet your intellectual standards. You have shined a lot at the campus and I am completely confident that you will continue to shine the same in future. But 1 thing is that your jokes are not that good quality :P. Your PJs are even worse than those snakes roaming around in the campus hahahahaha... SO work on that part too.. :) "
pgp31320,Diwakar Agrawal,Diwa,BCG,," Diwakar is well a very famous person in our batch (mostly among girls). He frequently asks doubt to the professors, which was very troublesome for people sitting around him (he sat just behind me) who wanted to stay away from professor's attention. People easily identify him being around as he always keeps on whistling or singing (and his singing is not very good :P). One warning to people, do not try to put effort into understanding his PJs."
pgp31320,Diwakar Agrawal,BCG_Material,,,"The way Diwakar carry himself all the time, the attire he chooses to wear, the sophistication he brings in his talks – never failed to inspire me in any front. His unparalleled commitment to improve himself and courage to take on every opportunity are just another feather in his cap. He, indeed, is a true professional. ""All the best for your future endeavor Diwakar"".            "
pgp31320,Diwakar Agrawal,Boss,,,"Boss, you have always commanded respect and awe from one and all right from the very first day. I feel glad that our paths crossed right from the marketing group in Term-1. From there on, I have tried to but have not yet attained the kind of sincerity and passion with which you approach work. Your thought process is marvelous. And you are not just about academics - your humour and wit are equally fascinating. Like a boss you will be signing off and I'm sure you will make it large in life. Cheers!!!      "
pgp31320,Diwakar Agrawal,DATA,GOD,SERIOUS,"We started on worst possible note I can imagine - Bio class activity. I am sorry for losing temper man. Over the period as I got to know you more, I realized what an amazing person you are! Your doubts, though nerve testing, made sense. Even though many like myself won't openly admit, but it is nice to have someone asking all the doubts around you. Mumbai and post Mumbai, I have learnt a lot from you. Thank you for helping me during Term 6. You were there on the rougher days and it means a lot. It has been a pleasure Mr. Agarwal! May you find the girl you desire! May you be a little less serious looking and may you farewell, always.                                           "
pgp31320,Diwakar Agrawal,Consultant,,,"A person whom I can always rely for advice related to career. A very humble and mischievous guy. He likes to give more than 100% for all his commitments. He his very sorted and so are his work. From day 1 he knew, where he had to focus and was always on his path. Will for sure leave his mark wherever he goes. You have got everything, now all you need his bit of Light......           "
pgp31320,Diwakar Agrawal,Consultant,,,"Hey Mr. Consultant. I still remember when you came to find out why I was upset even at 2 am when you heard my voice on call. Our friendship started while preparing for MM quiz & it has gone on & on now. Among us four, you were the one who made me look not that bad at certain occasions! (Our speed & understanding matches! :P) Thanks for having my back & tolerating my whims, well sometimes. You are a very caring person. Stay the same! Change just 1 thing, open up & ""come out of the closet"". All the best.. for your Thailand outing :D Friends Forever. Cheers, Tanvi               "
pgp31320 ,Diwakar Agrawal,Favourite,Guide,,"I will miss your PJs!:P It's weird how you can be so, so mature, intelligent, smart and super serious and then also crack the most stupid jokes possible. However, maybe that is what makes you so awesome!;) I've spent a great time with you on campus and definitely learnt a lot.     "
pgp31321,Anup Gholkar,Intelligent,Mature,Determined, You know that you were my first friend in the campus as we met at the Mumbai airport just before the day of registration. Your presence in the institute was an assurance to my father that his son won't be alone in the campus. Your dedication towards academics was something I always wished for myself. I felt very proud when I could found your name in the list of top 20 percent students. Your regular act of blood donation is one thing; I would like to follow in future. I really appreciate that behaviour. Your sarcasm ensured daily dose of laugh to our group. But sometimes it was so deep that I could not understand. You remember how we troubled you with Aur Dhikhao Aur Dhikhao texts after summer internship process.  I am confident that you will get what you have been dreaming for so long.  I wish you all the very best for the same.  
pgp31321,Anup Gholkar,SarcasmGod,I-Fear-Dogs,,"I am sitting here writing about you. And I was writing about your sense of humor and your sarcasm-in-every-sentence way of talking. I was writing about our fun times together – the trips to Rishikesh and Manali, the walks, the outings, the cricket, the group studies, and the prep help. I was writing that you are a wonderful human being on the inside and it is a blessing to have you in my life. And I was gonna crack a joke on your fear of dogs. Lol. (Remember SOM & LOL? Ha ha ha..) But, as I was writing that, the two of you just called me to your room and gave me the greatest good news! Wooo! :D *super-excited* Yayyy! (Sorry for writing this in your individual testimonial, but wohoo!) (And anyways, by the time everyone goes through the yearbook and reads this, it'll all be public knowledge already.) So, a big cheers to your great life ahead yaar! :D P.S. Show this to your children. ;P "

The best part about having you as a friend was being able to rely on you whenever needed. I'm hardly able to say this about     people, but in your case I can definitely say that I can rely on you. I'm sure you'll make a fantastic career and build a good life. Will definitely be dropping in at your place in Bangalore hence you need to get a studio apartment with space for the 6 of us whenever we decide to drop in.

With all the things going around with me, you were the one who was supportive all the time. I used to irritate you most of the time, I know but gradually it decreased, just to boost myself...:P Very moody, used to prank me a lot, drama queen many more bad things about you...:P You are a lovely girl, cheerful, explored so many restros in Lucknow, taught me how to party. Great things happened around you for me at this place. By God's grace or my luck, you are coming to Bangalore and our next destination is Bangalore. Hope we stay same for many more years to come. Best wishes for everything, I will not say stay in touch forever and all, because I know you will always be.   "

pgp31324,Isha Khan,Beautiful,,,Isha Khan!! So pretty!! So open!! So cute (sometimes only)!! So aggressive!! You don't keep it inside. You let everyone know what you feel. This is one thing I love about you. P.S. I'll never stop hitting on you. 
pgp31324,Isha Khan,Powerful,Beautiful,Enigmatic," It's rare to find a combination of strong yet gentle, tough yet kind, clever yet cute but this rarity is Ms. Khan personified. She is passionate, most caring, compassionate, benevolent, sagacious, a collective of talents and yet unpresuming. A free spirited, strong individual, delightfully chaotic and beautifully messed in herself, she is a gem of a person. Only a few know how much she'd care and go the distance for things that matter. A soul so kind that nursed a helpless, stranded baby squirrel almost dying and revived her back to health after constantly caring for numerous days. I found in you a cherished friend that equals my madness and contains my storms, without you I would not have been the same and ""Hell"" would have been a lot less memorable.                           "
pgp31324,Isha Khan,Issa,Annapoorna,,"The lady in charge of keeping the group well fed and in turn happy. No memory of how many times we've showed up hungry at her doorstep and she sent us away all full up to the brim. Also responsible for most of the group's food outings in lucknow. The group study nights & the special refreshments afterwards at bissu's room making us run to our room will never be forgotten. Aapke bina kya hi hota mere jaise bachche ka :P. A big heartfelt thanks for the awesome times, at the top of which stands the nainital trip _/\_      "
pgp31324,Isha Khan,Superhot,,,"Isssa. 2 years of IIML, you've been nothing short of an elder sister to me. From cooking me food to gossiping about the most random things, I never realized when you become my integral support system at Hell. You've been one of the major reasons I've learnt to *chill*. You've given me weird nick names and made me try such *new things*.. You're one person I can always rely upon no matter what. From judging people together to watching random videos to hogging food like there's no end, I never thought I could meet a girl like you. You are my super hot personal style guru. I love you too much but you already know that :*         "
pgp31324,Isha Khan,Hottie,Smart,,"You're a stunner, woman! You have the kindest eyes and the prettiest hair, that would make anyone go weak in the knees! You're an extremely well read person and a great conversationalist! I wish you good luck, girl! Mwah!   "
pgp31324,Isha Khan,Charismatic,Enchanting,Compassionate,"There is so much I want to say,but I don't know where to begin.One of the greatest friends one could ask for.If perfect friendship exists,she is the one.I can share every secret without having to worry about being judged.I could never be more thankful for having her in my life.We have studied, laughed, cried, fought, watched movies, explored Lucknow together(the list is endless).During all these, I have annoyed her, even angered her at times.But she has never let those feelings blemish our bond.She'll always act in the required way without having to tell her.She'll be a friend when you need companionship.She'll be a sister when you need wisdom or guidance.She'll be a mother when you need care and affection(She can even pet a lizard).This reminds me of her OCD with being organized and clean.She is like Monica Geller, may be a bit worse.She might just drop by in future only to check whether her inheritor is maintaining the room well.She may not be perfect.But Isha is someone who will be there for you;cheer you;inspire you.She's the one I'll be missing the most.I'm just trying to say that our friendship is irreplaceable.And even though we will be staying miles apart,bond we share is never going to fade. Loads and loads of hugs!   "
pgp31324,Isha Khan,Little,,, The most ticklish and sweet person I know. A freak of nature who doesn't gain weight. Be the way you are always...   
pgp31324,Isha Khan,Beautiful,Caring,Neat,"Khan sa, fewer people have had such a lasting impact on me as a person, the way you have had. For that in itself alone I can never be thankful enough. Your caring nature, charm coupled with the flare and hotness you carry is worth every moment spent around you! Among the few people I am sure of making big in life! Because you are nice person and nice people always make it through nicely! Take good care of yourself lady, nothing long to add for no amount of words explain the love and gratitude I have. All the best for everything aage! Meet-ups and parties await us on other side of campus. See you!                                         "
pgp31324,Isha Khan,Khan Sa,,,"She's really ticklish and starts giggling uncontrollably when she's tickled (sorry Isha, the secret's out :P) She's very feisty and is not afraid to speak her mind. Another thing I like about her is that she's a fellow 5 – footiya :P A true chota packet, bada dhamaka."
pgp31324,Isha Khan,Bold,,,"Our friendship dates back since April 2015, when we hadn't met in person even. And the day I opened my chit to see my allocated  room number, the first thing that I did was to call and tell her that we were going to be wall-mates. We met finally, and immediately the decision was made that we were not going to change our rooms! And we did not! Looking back, I realise we have partied hard, studied, made our CVs together with the ""family"", spent some amazing times in the library (not studying, though!), and of course, you and Pranay were the harbinger of the news that my summers was where I wanted it to be! We may not be seen together always, but I know that I can ping you anytime I want to and know that you will do whatever it takes to help me out. Handling disappointments, celebrating joys, pulling legs and what not. So Ishu, I wish you a really great future and for all our dreams (yeah, we seem to have some really similar ones!..P)  to come true! Cheers!   "
pgp31324 ,Isha Khan,Fovourite-Person,,,Ishaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! Love you :* The one who has pampered me and loved me like an elder sister would! I can't help but expect to always be a kid around you! All your love means a lot to me      
pgp31326,Jaydeep Singh,PunjabiBhaiya,,," Bhai Bhai!!! Bhai Bhai!!! No words can explain the bond we shared throughout these 2 years. Many memories will stay with me forever. JATS, Kasol, Sports, MARS everything is and will be epic. P.S. Most of the Punjabi songs which you listen to SUCKS!!"
pgp31326,Jaydeep Singh,Exuberant,Vivacious,Kind," The most humble, down to earth, spirited and utterly amazing person. It's almost impossible to be in JD's company and be aloof, quiet and sad, he'd take it upon himself to cheer you up, mix you in and won't let you be unless you are enjoying around. But always ready to extend a helping hand no matter what the circumstance be, you can trust him whenever the need be. From being the first of my friends in section to being the most trusted ones, the journey with you and Isha has been amazing and to be missed the most. I take back cherished memories of us, both of you ganging up on me, your reluctance to let me near your hypothetical future kids and so on. Lucky to have found a cherished friend in you who has been beside me through my highs and lows.                           "
pgp31326,Jaydeep Singh,JD,,," It is nice talking with you especially because of your carefree attitude that really inspires me. Be the same, keep smiling, and Stay in touch                               "
pgp31326,Jaydeep Singh,JATS,,," Honestly, you were one of those few people that I was petrifed of. You never spoke a word to me and your looks were always deadly. And I know Deepika felt the same way for a long time. Thank God that you opened your mouth and finally let us in on your coolness. I sincerely hope that Kraft acquires HUL. Much love and more swag coming your way. "
pgp31326,Jaydeep Singh,Sexy,,," I remember this random conversation I had one day where I was asked who I would date, and I said I would date you. You are a real nice guy and though compared to others I have spent less time with you but I have to say it was always fun. Especially Gurgaon.  Stay this way &#61514; "
pgp31326,Jaydeep Singh,JD,-,-,"JD, you got the looks and personality to scare the people around you. Even I was scared initially. But when I got to know you, you are like the coconut- andar se ek dum naram. Always remain sexy JD.         "
pgp31326,Jaydeep Singh,Charming,Nonchalant,,"Day 1 of classes of Section F at CR109. New, strange faces all around. My eyes scanning each one them, scouting for potential partners in crime. There is this innocent-faced guy sitting quietly behind me. Turns out, he is the most 'bakchod' person in our section (It is rightly said that don't judge a book by its cover :P). Jaydeep is fun to be around. He has a knack of passing comments, which are quite witty indeed. The thing that I admire the most is his ability to stay calm and composed at all times. I've shared a wall with him for about a year, and all I can say is that he is genuine, warm-hearted and a humble fellow with immense potential. I've always enjoyed our bike trips searching for different tea tapris in the city. He has irritated me at times, but those incidents brought us closer, building a bond that grows stronger with each passing day.    "
pgp31326,Jaydeep Singh,,,,
pgp31326,Jaydeep Singh,SundarSaheli,,,"Day 1 of the classes, I saw you in the same row as mine and I thought he is so thin and pretty. You became the best neighbor I could have hoped for, helping me tolerate the unbearable first year. I dreaded spending a single class without you sitting next to me. From sharing stupid horror stories, talking about miseries of life, love and crushes, gossiping and bitching about classmates, I loved our never ending conversations. The way we sung during the lectures and laughed crazily will remain among the best of my memories. You are and will always be my ziddi and sundar saheli with strikingly ugly feet.      "
pgp31326,Jaydeep Singh,Hero,Loyal,Committed,"Pehli section party yaad hai? What fun man! You were the party maker I guess, mixing, rolling thy way to glory!

See you on the other side of campus buddy. Take care and all the best for everything ahead.                                                   "
pgp31326,Jaydeep Singh,JD,-,-," You are the perfect definition of a friend jo 'Der aaye durust aaye'. You have taught people how to behave like ""men"", how to roll a roll and how to say 'Bhak Sala' with passion. I love how you play your favorite Punjabi songs at parties, irrespective of people not liking them. The way you have always provided food, clothing and shelter to Balu shows how kind-hearted you are. Your long term goal of growing crops on the slopes of 'Kasol' despite not being an ABM grad shows how ambitious you are. JD, my go to person for 'Zakhamo pe patti', you are awesome! May you never get any Zakham in life for me to return the favour.   "
pgp31326,Jaydeep Singh,Master Jedi,,,"A really cool guy, he knows how to mix a drink and tickle your funny bone. Always a delight to banter with him – he always has something funny to say. And you can see that he's well loved by his group of friends – the JATS :P Stay funny, JD \m/"
pgp31326,Jaydeep Singh,JD,,,"Zaydee!!! You are one of your kinds. The day when I feel a little low, all that I need to do it is let you know. You have the ability to set the party mood with your expertise and those punjabi tracks. The amazing basketball captain with his brigade of basketball kids. JD you make a wonderful friend. Always there whenever needed, always protecting, always entertaining and always tripping. Raichu and CV are glad to be in JD's perpetual friend list. JD and CV shall party for years to come in a lot of cities and then you protect CV from Chinese people. Cheers. Love.    "

pgp31326 ,Jaydeep Singh,Punjabi,,,JD is one who knows when to enjoy and when to be serious. You are the life of all parties. Your punjabi songs set the mood. I would never forget Gurgaon and Tom Collins. Hope to recreate that magic soon.

I remember what you told me the other day when you and Sai were sitting and I joined you, and also how casually you insulted Kolkata in front of me. You love having arguments and it's funny arguing with you because you're a real sport and don't take little thing to heart. But I am telling you it was you who hit me on the head and ran into the mess :P It was someone really tiny and really quick. Has to be has to be YOU !! Cheers :) "

pgp31327,Rachana Kanikarla,Bro,Smart,Anti,"Neighbor!!! The first person I talked to in the new section F. Over the next 6 months, it was a roller coaster ride, as was the time at IIM Lucknow. Who would I do incessant perverted talks with now? There was no one who would be so much actively carry out conversations! Thanks for being the partner in crime during all those lectures. I wonder how they would have lasted without you! I am glad we could do more courses when I returned and occupy the adjacent seats! Will always remember the loudly echoing - Aye Fuckerrr! Take super good care of yourself. Thank you for those sweet little moments, I don't know if I ever showed enough appreciation or not. Good luck for everything that comes aage.

I hope it'll keep you jolly always. "
pgp31328,Kannav  Mahajan,Crazy,Vivacious,Fun," The world & everything else seems so much slower, so much low on energy and so much dim in laughter when Kannav Mahajan is in the frame because you outmatch everything around.

pgp31328,Kannav  Mahajan,Bak-bak,Tharki,n,"One of the best friendships carried forward from stex. Hardly had we talked to each other before. Kannav is the opposite of lazy and we at times wonder from where he derives the insane energy he carries. Crazy parties and outings in Paris were possible only because of him. Since Kannav Mahajan knows everyone, so while hanging out you too get to meet lot many people. You can never get bored with this guy, his continuous chatter ensures that (:P)! For those who don't know him, he'd keep speaking and speaking and speaking. So feel free to interject anytime, he won't mind. He's one of those who'd go an extra mile in each and every task taken up. It was great knowing him and I'm sure this friendship is gonna last for long!                 "
pgp31328,Kannav  Mahajan,TheGreatNetworker,,,"The first person to meet from campus. i still remembered the first day when we shared the cab, while the sadness of being away from home was taking over me, you kept me engaged with your conservation diverting my thoughts! i wondered if the people on campus would be as friendly as you. you are the epitome of networking and striking conversations;). Though we were not closest of the friends, i believe we will remain good friends :)      "
pgp31328,Kannav  Mahajan,Anokha,,," You are an open book, and that is what is super appealing about you. If there is one person on campus I really wish I could know better, then that would be you. Ironic as it is, our first conversation was our longest (remember, summer placements ;)). But considering how easy it is to talk to you, there is no hope lost at all. You were a wonderful host in Paris and your energy is infectious. Keep smiling, don't consider changing yourself for anybody. My Dubai room is waiting for your sleeping bag :P  "
pgp31328,Kannav  Mahajan,Kannu,-,-,"Kannu, we have had a long journey together. From being friends in our MR party, to you being a constant support for me in F section parties. You made sure I was always included and I am thankful to you for that. And most importantly thank you jaaneman for all the help you gave during Stex, I couldn't have done ti without you. Our awesome trips together, the feeling of home with you, tasty food, I will always cherish everything. You are insanely cute and helpful Kannu. I love you so much. In the future, I will be there for you baby. Always.      "
pgp31328,Kannav  Mahajan,Kota buddy,Rotlu,," Well, I know Kannav from my Kota days (and everyone must have heard the story several times from Kannav about how we used to sit on the same bench there). When I got selected into IIM-L, and saw his name also in the list, I was way too excited to finally meet him after so many years. He is very talkative, emotional and way too open to people (don't think or hesitate before speaking anything). If you are his friend, be sure to receive souvenirs or greeting cards from him, and also being tagged on several emotional posts on social media."
pgp31328,Kannav  Mahajan,Kanu,Nestle,,My brother from another mother. We are like mirror images – both at the zenith of extrovertist nature. I remember DDG telling that he used to look at two focal points in the class and that was the two of us. I admire the enthusiasm that you have which is often times more than even mine. I like how you remember the small things for everyone around you and be ever ready to make them happy. You care about others and always try to help them. It was great meeting you and getting to know that there is someone out there so much like me. 
pgp31328,Kannav  Mahajan,Spirited,Passionate,Talkative,"Frankly speaking, I did not like Kannav when I met him first. Who would? Incessantly conversing with the prof as if he is the only one listening intently. He was like a newly admitted school kid trying to impress the teacher to become the favourite student. Our first actual conversation was about a mutual friend, and we ended up laughing discussing his stories. As our interaction increased, I realized he is not bad as I thought him to be. Obviously, he talks a lot (for an infinitely long time).But that is something which is in his blood. He can't help it. He goes on and on and on despite being interrupted, or stopped, or cursed (basically no one can stop him once he decides to talk). Anyways, behind those countless words, is an intelligent, terrific and a pleasant (add whining too) soul. A charming personality, indeed. He puts his heart into anything he does. I am inspired by his passion and devotion. The best times we spent together were, of course, in Mumbai during the internship; wandering across different localities and always ending up on the Marine Drive. I can confidently say that I have found a loyal, valuable and a wonderful friend in him. Love you Bro!!   "
pgp31328,Kannav  Mahajan,TalkativeChild,,,"Day 1 of Section F and could not help but notice you: so high on energy and super cute! You made sure that the classes should never be silent and we all knew we have someone to save from CP for you did it all. In most classes, when I could hardly open my eyes out of sleep I would just look at my left and we would share a glance, smile on some unsaid joke and carry on. Surely you talk but I am kind of good in handling it. You are full of life.  You have a heart of a kid, innocent and loving. I wonder if you know how to say 'no' to anyone for anything. A wonderful friend and a good human being, you are someone I am sure the entire batch will remember. I wish you best of everything Kaanu!      "
pgp31328,Kannav  Mahajan,Chutya,Chutya,Chutya,"FLAWSOME – the word that comes to my mind whenever I think of Kanav, this guy embraces his flaws and knows he is awesome regardless. 
Someone you'd always find brimming with life, he can easily squeeze 40 hours out from a day. He can be found everywhere – in classes, mess, Paris, on Facebook and in Room # 1110 - all at the same time.
He has put extraordinary efforts to hone his skill to crib about everything in life. He has a problem with introverts, with India, with Paris, with the Sun rising in the East, and with - Just give him a topic!! He also has a compulsive desire to be noticed by people around – to be the cynosure. In his words, ""Negative publicity is still publicity"". To aid himself in this pursuit he has developed a knack for turning any conversation vulgar. 
Kanav is dangerously friendly too. He sees no extremes in helping people and taking no credit for it (will surely crib about it later though). With a happy-go-lucky attitude, he handles criticism really well. A very warm and welcoming host, he has been someone I could always pour my heart out to. 
Dekh bhai, irritate toh tune bahut kiya hai, but ab achcha lagta hai toh lagta hai.. You will always be the most important topic of discussion for Sankhe and me ;)   "

pgp31328,Kannav  Mahajan,Friendship,,, He is the one who never differentiates between the friends and is loyal to his each and every friend. He can die for friends and can die without friends. He was our sole savior from professor. Section F DCP God. He was there for us even when he was not in India. Always made sure that our group is active. He was the one who made section F into a family. The first person to reach for every party and the last one to leave. Mr. Mahajan Consultant ab senti hona kaam karna post IIM Lucknow        
pgp31328,Kannav  Mahajan,Bro,Mr. Bootiful Legs,,"I don't really believe in best friends but he was close enough to be one. I'll always be grateful to him for introducing me to the set of people who have gone on to become good friends on me. In fact, the little social life that I had on campus is all thanks to him.
He's a misunderstood soul thanks to the boundless energy he's got and his enthusiasm for talking about everything under the sun. His ability to remember so many things never fails to amaze me.
Had fun being his  wing(wo)man in the early days of year 1. Got used to all forms of verbal abuses thanks to being stuck at his hip all the time :P I'm grateful to him for all those walks and gyaan, which I ended up ignoring any way :P 
Thanks for the memories, bro!"
pgp31328,Kannav  Mahajan,Dynamic,Extrovert,ChickMagnet,Kannav= Section F. There is no Section F without Kannav ( or Kannuuu darling as his female fans fondly call him :p) This guy is so awesome that there are no words in the English dictionary that can describe him properly except fabulous :p There is never a dull moment when he is around. His energy and passion for life uplifts you even when you're having a bad day. His pervert jokes bring a smile on your face. He is one of the most helpful people that I met in IIM Lucknow. I met Kannav during one of the Council/Senate meets. I found him very easy going and fun to talk to. We both love football ( support rival teams ) and hot women ( tho he has some male crushes too :p). He was the life and soul of our section parties. All the girls used to be like *DJ wale kannuuu mera gaana bja do.. gaana bja do.. gaana bja do* ( I'm sure he's thinking of a pervert joke while reading this :p). The most memorable time was the Banaras trip. We all had the best time thanks to Kannav's planning. I wish we can have more trips in the future. I will miss you Kannav. I wish you get all the happiness and success in life (and some hot chicks :p)

You were the best host ever and then you became the best tour guide. Trust me, I loved Paris only because of that evening with you and Priyal.

I admire how you approach academics for knowledge and that reflects in the aura that you possess.

He's largely responsible for me not getting any Ds in the first year :P He's also empathetic and has helped me more than once in dealing with my relationships with people here.

Pgp31334,Nilesh Soni,SelflessBanda,SuperDude,,A fun loving and amazing guy who lives his life for his friends. He is ready to help anyone and is very broad and open minded. His selfless attitude and hardworking nature makes him a perfect CEO.   
Pgp31334,Nilesh Soni,Soni,CEO,CEOni,"Sonyyy!!
You're always ready to help everyone and I really appreciate you for this. It's always fun to hang out with you.  The one thing I really want to learn from you is how to network with people. Like seriously dude, how do you do this!? 
One scene I vividly remember is the last day of trek, when you were collecting all the used bottles near our tent and arranging all our luggage and the only thing I could think of is, ""Ye ladka kabhi shantise nahi baith sakta"" :P
P.S.: Thank you for the all the useful sites you shared :P   "
Pgp31334,Nilesh Soni,CEO,Ceoni,," Soni gradually became 'Ceoni' by the end of his tenure as CEO. I haven't seen anyone evolve so much in a matter of 20 odd months. Despite continuing to remain hyperactive, over a period of time he has learnt to channel his energies. Be it competitions, PORs, parties, trashy discussions you name it and this guy would have done it. If there were a Olympics for multitasking this guy will get few golds. The way he resolved issues pertaining to student bodies in amicable ways is mind blowing and is a fact known to very few making him an unsung hero of IIML. Humility and empathy in people at positions of power is a rare commodity and this person has a truck load of it. Always up for a party or a trip, no matter how big or small. He is one of the food 'hogger' on campus and you can find him in mess at all possible times. His phone is an evidence to his obsession with Selfies. Check it & you will see what may appear like a feature film roll. Fun Fact. Make him laugh and see how his face turns red in a minutes. Survival Tip: Don't go to mess with him. He knows everyone on the campus and will make you wait endlessly till he is done with his niceties. Song Dedication: Mai aisa ku hun. "
Pgp31334,Nilesh Soni,Sony,,,"You are one of a kind, and trust me, I am not saying it just for the sake of it. I mean it when I say that talking to you has changed my perspective about things in significant ways. I know I can count on you, and I won't ever have to think twice before giving you a call !

I don't think it would all have been possible without you. Never. L gave me many friends, but you hold one key position among all of them. Nobody, was as Indori yet close and supportive as you were, despite having a committee by your side to be handled. Thanks man! All the best. Be like this always.              "

I befriended you only coz of all the benefits and facilities you were providing to the group. You do not consider me as your friend but I do. Of course because of 500crore, Raichura Mansion, finance subjects, group projects, MV FashP etc. P.S. Don't forget our deal of sponsoring me for that competition. P.P.S. You have been the best wingman to me. "
pgp31335,Nirali Raichura,Sweetheart,,,"Sweetest, goofiest and an amazing person. It was so much fun working together on FashP, although most of the work you pulled it off alone. Have always been a fan of your cute craziness.     "

Waking you up is such a nightmare for anybody and I pity anyone who shall have to do it (:P).. Jokes aside, you're a lovely person who is super fun and crazy and we'll definitely have many more crazy memories! "

You know how to live life to the fullest and that sets you apart. The first person I saw getting high on dance was you. Your niralizz and crawling is just out of the world. Nirali, I truly want to thank you for all the support during placements. Your last day motivation made the things different for me. Our shahrukh khan movie is still due but we will make it done someday. Be as you are, enjoy to the fullest, I am always there for you.. Loved your massages and caring.

I missed a chance to be in the Raichu Mansion. I'm saving that for another date. All the best for the future, your gujju dimaag will never let you down. "

Our Kolkata parties, your section parties to which I was always a member, all birthdays we celebrated, the Raichura attacks, the movies we have seen together (with lots and lots of cold drinks), our shopping day, your love for cheese and sleep, our all studying time together in 4th term, making you watch red films, and most importantly you have provided me emotional support in this last term.

You are among the few people I got a chance to talk a lot with, so this testimonial won't ever be enough to capture all of that!

Glad to see that she's moved on to the real stuff now and is rocking at it :P I first really noticed her (and got thoroughly impressed by her) when she took Amritansh's interview in a BIO session and nearly killed him with her questions and replies. For all her goofiness, she's a very smart person. 
I used to think that I loved sleeping but Nirali probably trumps everyone on campus when it comes to sleeping. Most days you would catch her, running to class, always a couple of minutes late :P
Oh, and if you're wondering who Sikander is, it's the pole in front of Gate 1, to whom NIrali got married (and promptly divorced too) in term 1 :P"

Being poles apart made us appreciate each other's thoughts even more. With your beautiful acts of love and caring you crawled your way into my heart so deep that now we are forever Shivu and Raichu.

pgp31338,Pratyusha Biswas,Roomie,,," I forget the number of times I called you 'roomie' when people asked who you were- looking back it's probably because friend is not enough to cover what you mean to me. From tiny insignificant details of each other's lives to the biggest moments of happiness, from bored lazy days to crazy hectic schedules, from heartbreaks and pain to small successes- I've lived every moment with you and for that I am forever grateful.
I'm sorry for that mushy message that's probably making your macho self a little uncomfortable. So here's a small snapshot of memories that have been among the best I have made on campus- you practically living in my room all of term 2, shouting to each other across closed doors, you quietly sneaking out food from my loud parties, breaking down your door at 12am for the amazing birthday presents you so painstakingly made, you coming down to 3 so religiously just to randomly chat with me, breakfasts, lunches and dinners together, cartoon movies that somehow seemed fun with you, walks and swings and deep conversations, little fights and lots of happiness…you've been the most beautiful thing that happened to me at L. Be forever good, be forever an introvert, be forever you- because you're amazing. Love forever"

Despite your child-like nature sometimes and small tiffs :P(I hardly remember any) you have made us stay together in a group and cared for each of us. G'n'B would not have run smoothly had you not sorted things out whenever things go wrong. I like your persistence attitude that you apply during various situations small or big.

Anyways, easily the most fired up person in the class, in the 2nd term! No matter how much people say, it was good to see someone prepared and taking it to the professor! It wasn't good when you were rating us out though! It was good interacting with you, especially cause if your energy - Easily amongst the Indians from the south, even beating the sloth sitting beside you! Keep it going Rolla!

You were always sweet and would give me company whenever you found me sitting alone in the mess. You're a rock!
It was fun teaching you Hindi abuses. You were a good student :P I'll miss your 'Tch Tch's and 'Hey Sanke!' s. Thanks for the momo-ries, Rolla! :P"
pgp31341,Abishek S,StudBoy,,,I remember that when we first met you thought that I was some kind of gunda and was scared of me. I should have kept such image of me in front of you throughout.

pgp31341,Abishek S,KungFuPanda,,,"'The most-suited for an MBA' personality – Abishek is one of those very few people who values logic in life. He is smart and is a no non-sense person when it comes to moving things ahead. He is really hardworking and likes to take responsibility of whatever he does.
With friends, however, he is a completely different person. He has been a pain in the ass for everyone in ""Compass Company"" consistently for these 2 years. He would drive you insane with no consideration what-so-ever. The best part about him is his ability to make fun of himself. 
He has definitely been one of the most humorous persons on campus. His ability to keep you entertained is extra-ordinary. He is super confident about everything he speaks, perhaps the only person who can ace an investment banking interview with HR specialization.
He is the only one who comes close to match my love for pizzas (though I can still beat you easily at that). Not to forget, what gossipmonger you are! You might as well be the perfect replacement of 'Karan Johar' on his talk show. The way you make people feel comfortable, to get them to start talking just to make fun of them again!!

You will rock wherever you go. All the very best for your future endeavors.   
pgp31341,Abishek S,StudBoy,,," StudBoy - the word he uses for everyone. He is the one who pulls everyone legs, which sometimes make someone cries (Revolution case). A very humble and true friend. He was always there to motivate and help me during my lows. Beware of him,he can hell out of you (MessCom 32 can describe this better). Boss leave all your mischievous act, now your days of Launda are gone, be ready to become Uncle in few months time. Build your dictionary of hindi slang words....       "

I could always (almost always) rely on him to speak on my behalf during project ppts..forever grateful to him for that :P 
Beware of him though – he's got a way of making people talk and spill their secrets to him :P Stay fat, moron and thank you for the good times \m/"
pgp31341 ,Abishek S,Panda,Smart,," One of the few people who will always have logical arguments. Can be critical about some people and girls :p Very very hardworking and dedicated.

pgp31342,SAKET AGARWAL,Confidence,Networking,,"I think you were one of the 1st friend I made at IIM Lucknow. I initially thought that since you had so much work experience and me being a fresher, we would not be able to connect well. However,all those misconceptions proved untrue. You proved to be very cool guy to hang out with.You were the person with whom I had most of the interaction in term 1. Very few people know how much talented, experienced and well-networked guy you are. You were one of the guys I called up during emergencies It was really nice spending 2 years as your wingmate.           "
pgp31342,SAKET AGARWAL,Nightmess,,," Saket, I think it was the joke on SGAG that made us friends in the middle of first year itself. Since then there has been no turning back. You have been an amazing friend all along the way. It was so nice to know you. During placement ops we became even good friends. If I had to go somewhere all I needed to do was to call you and you were there. After that we even became subject-mates and have tolerated most boring lectures together. You are the mess guy. Stay as you are and always keep smiling. Be in touch "
pgp31342,SAKET AGARWAL,Dedicated,Sleepy,Helpful,"I have always found you sleepy in you room , but always ready to wake up and do anything required.This is just a result of your extreme dedication to the night mess and your work. You enjoy life a lot , but are also mindful of the people around you and try to help them out.I have taken a lot of help from you in many things and you have always helped me out.Your passion towards your work and your persistence would take you to great heights in life.You just have to wait for the right time. The numerous excursions to night mess and snacks would be missed. I wish you all the best for your future journey in life and hope that you would remain in contact with me.  "
pgp31342,SAKET AGARWAL,Playboy,,,"Saket bhai, our own pseudo mess secretary, you have been a great friend indeed in the last one year. You have given me food so many time going out of your way, helped me in so many ways and always been there for me. You are the nicest person at IIM Lucknow who is always happy, cheerful and forgiving to others. I will continue to cherish all the time spent on your room, in my room, in night mess, in parties, during those campus walk. Thanks for all the moral support and making last year at Hel(L) memorable for me. I wish you could have helped me in some other ways too :P :)  "
pgp31342,SAKET AGARWAL,Jugaadu,,," Saket is the most 'Jugaadu Banda' in our entire batch. He has maintained such good networking with shopkeepers, vendors, mess-employees, that friendship with him ensures that one would have access to all kind of resources. His strategic planning at year start for complete year (understood by his wing mates :P :P) was really commendable. One can always find him watching movies online (especially on Friday nights) in his room, and he still claims to have most busy academic schedule. All this kept aside, he is a very good person by heart, and always ready to help others."
pgp31342,SAKET AGARWAL,Networked,,,"You may have a problem in initiating conversations with strangers, but this guy doesn't have. He not only can initiate the conversation but also bring it to a logical conclusion. This is his capability to convert strangers to not-so-stranger-after all, is what I admire the most. Reasons behind all the girls 'going crazy' after him could only be achieved through judicious utilisation of his capability. Just a casual suggestion – Don't embarrass yourself by asking who was his prom partner.     "
pgp31342,SAKET AGARWAL,casanova,,,"Dude, I don't know where to begin. I had thought people here at IIM-L lack emotions before I came to know you although you do become a drama queen at times - then you are difficult to handle :P . You are aggressively possessive about your friends and employees - a quality that will take you quite ahead in life - cause to attain fanatic fandom is difficult and your people revere you. Girls are mad after you and its still a mystery to me how you manage to do so - I believe you come across as (and are too) a very happy and caring person - do remain so always. You have made my life easier here at IIM-L - I have blindly depended upon you which you have cruelly exploited many a times as well. I admire your love for movies, food and travel and want you to always be your fun self. I am sure you will do great in life and will impact many a lives wherever you go. All the best.       "
pgp31342,SAKET AGARWAL,Jugaadu,,,"Saket is a very dedicated person I have met on campus. He has been running night mess with the same passion which he shows for watching movies. Saket has been known to watch every movie on the release date (on his laptop :P).I have enjoyed many discussions with him about campus politics, mess functioning may more. As I jokingly tell him, He is the go-to man for any work you may have (Something which has been noticed by every girl of the junior batch :P). Have his number on speed dial and call him up for any work you might want to get done; He will have some contact for it and some cheaper way to do it :).  Wish you great success.  "
pgp31342,SAKET AGARWAL,Brilliant,Hardworking,Loyal,"Quizzer, class sleeper and many more things! I guess thanks to our seat locations, I got to know you so much better than many others did.

Take good care of yourself! You are a dedicated chap and a sincere person! I wish you all the success and joys ahead man! Again, May or July, we meet for sure!                                            "

Each and every moment that I have shared with you is epic and crazy and awesome. Coz you are awesome. "
pgp31344,Nimisha Sankhe,Kind,Cute,Wonderful," Cutest Cat Lady! I don't understand how does she manages to be so calm, composed and serene all the time. She wouldn't ever deny to any sort of help you ask for, helpful and so kind. It's so cute to see her around cats & pups, it seems like watching anime in real life.                 "

pgp31344,Nimisha Sankhe,Cats,Coffee,Colors,"Heroine, item, darling, bro and the list goes on. The sheer number of adjectives remain a testament to the number of roles you have played in my life since July, 2015. I don't recall anyone having a more telling impact on my life. You are among those few people who have made Lucknow probably one of the most memorable periods of my life. Hanging around, learning about unusual things, cats, coffee and so much more has been a fun of a different kind. Dealing with your laziness is a scary task and though I don't think many have survived that, I am still honored to have been a witness to that. Your nature has been inspirational and has helped me become a more mature, giving person. At the same time, it has helped me accept different facets of life. Being grateful for having met you, for having been your buddy and for having had you as parter in crime and projects is the least I can feel and express. Unfortunately Paris took away the chance to spend more time together, still, we managed to survive that, all thanks to you. I will miss a lot about you post IIM Lucknow but I am super sure of sticking around and pestering you more beyond it. Take good care of yourself lady. All the best for every little and big thing. So long, bro!    "
pgp31344,Nimisha Sankhe,Shaanpatti,Mother,,"'Sankhe', as she is usually called, is the perfect 'chota packet – bada dhamaka'. She is that typical 'tapori' from Mumbai (minus the daring bit). Almost instantly liked by everyone she meets, she has this knack of comforting people with her company. 
Sankhe has no purpose in life. She believes strongly in the ultimate state of death and hence finds everything before that useless. Don't be fooled by her innocent looks however, she will see no limits to pester you once she is 'friends' with you! 
Her love for coffee and cats sees no parallel. Even 'Kanav' might slip to the third position when she has to make a choice among the three. Getting high on coffee and torturing her cat is a ritual she never forgets to perform.
She also has an artistic bent of mind. She paints really well, sketches beautifully and writes long letters to one of her three favourites (mentioned above). Most importantly, she has mastered the art of giving zero f**ks in life.
To me, she has been a constant source of illogical discussions, a very dear friend and somebody who I'd always think of and smile. I am sure there'll be no one who can remotely match this 'item' in my life. All the best for life chirkut. Stay in touch :')

pgp31344,Nimisha Sankhe,Ailurophile,,," The most cutest girl of my batch and my bench mate in section F. Her sweet voice and ""Aye"" can force anyone to be friend with her. A girl who never took tension of anything in this Hell ride, but still will be awake whole night for nothing. Coffee is her lifeline and cat is her life. A general person some type of cuisines for food, she prefers only coffee doesn't matter whether it is breakfast, lunch or dinner.      "

And sharing things I never shared with anyone else on campus. It was definitely fun listening to your epic conversations with your Mom. Hope I could do the same someday. Somehow, I have been influenced by you extremely when it comes to thinking how I want my future to be.

I hope that life treats you well and that you open up a little more. Mostly because for people like me it is otherwise really difficult to get to know you better. Take care, good luck for everything my friend.                "

The level of energy she showed in various activities was simply awesome. But don't let this seriousness fool you, she was usually a powerhouse in all our parties too. Though she will forget all her after-parties incidents in the next morning. Her dance moves and other actions with Ankita deserves an honorary mention here. "" A chup raho tum.."" was her classical reply for all my puns and jokes about her and 'shisu'. She really loves to get clicked and upload pics on FB.  I knew many of the boys who were her secret or openly admirers. But she is still waiting for the special one. :P Her wish to go to Agra with OIG people remains unfulfilled.

I remember how we didn't perform well in so many case studies, even she was as enthusiastic for the next case study as that of the first one. She is also very truthful and humble by heart. She has an uncanny ability to be truthful in a nice manner when others are perplexed what to do. Be it sports like- badminton, volleyball; be it extra-curricular like dance, events she is always there and winning them all mercilessly. I would also like to thank you for teaching me patience.  PS.

I know if I ask you for something you will stand firmly on it with me, just as you do on your mistakes saying that you knew that thing from childhood &#61514; I couldn't hit on you only because there would have been too many connections in this small world thing.

Also, we both love FOOD! What more do I need in a friend. So yes in a few weeks' time, I'm coming to Indore to try all the amazing food you can't stop talking about :P :D Also, if we both get Mumbai for our jobs, I can totally imagine us ""going out"" every weekend to some café, restaurant, tapri to try some amazing food and DESSERTS.
I want to take the time today to thank you and tell you how important you are to me. Sometimes it's tough to say these things in person, even to a best friend. Thank you for always being on my side. I know I can I always count on you for the smallest of things like bringing me food from mess just because I'm a lazy being to listen to me rant about the stupidest of things. The best thing about you is that you're always there whenever I need someone to just listen and not judge me. 
Thanks sweetheart. I love you!   "
pgp31346,Shilpy Bhageria,Shilpai,Kanun,," Shipaai or ShilpY with a Y is one the most interesting persons you will meet on campus. She is an extremely soft-spoken person till you know her well enough. Post that inflection point, you will struggle to make a point in front of you. This Selfie freak will take more photos of herself than all the others put together and surprisingly most of them will turn out to be pretty good. Her lean and tall looks morph the sportsperson in her.  She is one of the all-rounders you will see around. I continue to regret playing badminton with her once when I was beaten up black and blue both literally and figuratively. Another area she aces is at dancing and will dance like no one is watching and those watching will always be pleasantly amused. 'Hi ShilpY' with both hands in the air is our thing and starting every statement with 'Guys!' is her thing. Lastly, she has a brilliant taste for old Bollywood tunes and will start humming from the 60s and 70s out of nowhere. Fun Fact. The collection of snacks at her room can give a Haldiram store, a run for their money. Survival Tip: Don't try to prove that the cuisine of your home town is better than that of Indore.

Bas abb aur senti nahi karta tujhe nahi toh tu ro degi."

You are the one with whom I felt like home from very beginning, that's why I used to get a sound sleep in your room during 1st year. All the time spent with you was amazing whether it be selecting dresses, gossiping, watching series, teaming against you with shubham or teju or eating together. You are the best beautician that I can ever have and my all happiness is incomplete without you. Now, a truth that would make you happy is when I taunt you about not spending time with me, it is just for troubling you, I know that you feel bad about it but there is no need at all. Pyaar to dil me hona chahiye janemann. Bas keep sharing your problems with me, it makes me feel special and will make you feel light. The best decision that I have taken here is to shift my room in 2nd year that bought us closer.Luv u baby,sorry for making u cry, just hope that your all wishes are fulfilled and you get what you aspire for.

Remember the conversation where we both said that the friendship where silence is comfortable is one of the best. Am glad I have that with you. Baby if I was Jane Austen, you would be my Lizzy :P Love you! "
pgp31347,Shivi Garg,Funny,Smart,Lovable," Our friendship dates back to MBA interviews and in that brief meeting you had an impact. Thanks for making me comfortable that day. And I still appreciate the fact that you recognised me with my changed look after coming here. It has been a pleasure to know you. Your sweet voice is a treat to ears and your sense of lyrics just adds a wow factor. Your typical ""Power Brake"" laughter tops the chart when it comes to peculiar habits. ""Apparently"" I find a place in your ""BEST FRIENDS"" list, but for me you surely are on top. Life would have been less fun without your ""Grandma Stories"", ""Silly Jokes"", ""Level 1 Info"". Thanks for being the golgappa partner, sudden trip enforcer and my ""FRIENDS buddy"". If I can get a chance to become someone else, I would become you. Cheers  to us and always be the person you are."
pgp31347,Shivi Garg,Baby,Shivi,3.4,"This is the most painful testimonial of all because saying bye to you had even earlier been very difficult and even now it is. It was almost unbelieveable how early and easily we clicked, it was just like 2nd or 3rd day together that we are dancing together. Insane family name similarities we have, it was destiny for us to be sisters. To make your room my home, your section my section, we have shared everything. Too many good memories to write down, the best times were when we dozed off together listening to music, or the late night campus walks, the sunrises together, the drinking compatibility we had and the perfectly coordinated dance of ours for hours. You have tolerated me a lot I know baby but please don't leave me ever. Wish to make more and more memories together. Love you to the moon and back.

You became a great friend over a period, starting right from those epic section parties! Our energies match and so does our insanity! Maybe that adds to the flavour of our friendship! Your maturity and your smile stood out and I guess would always stand out! Missed you a lot in Paris, but I do hope we have our chance at making up for the lost time!

Our euro trip was one crazy ride, the highlight being your dog like swimming in the water (I made sure not to make it sound dirty).

I always liked his clever remarks during OIG meets and parties very amusing. He seems a very serious guy but can be equally hilarious with his subtle style of speaking. He has some special dance moves which can compel anybody to come on the dance floor with him. It was great working with you in OIG.

Because, good times or bad, quiz marks or CGPA, Ghivari can remember everything. You might have learned a lot of globe here, but 'Target Acquisition' was your USP since the beginning. And I keep learning about your hidden talents like sneaking food. How you repeat stuff others say, how you catchup on random lingo like 'bada wala' and keep on using it repeatedly and how you sleep with your shoes on is adorable. The way you say 'ok' in your signature style and the sound of your hearty laugh makes you.. you! Ops king, my gossip buddy, you are a great friend!   "

Last 2 years were a roller coaster of emotions which taught me how people from completely different backgrounds like us can come together and perform a task to near perfection if they believe and stand with each other as mentioned in the Three Musketeers film ""All for one and one for all"".

We have spent the most amazing, craziest and lovely moments together.. Late night campus walks.. Never ending conversations.. Daily movie plans.. Crackle to uplift my mood and many many more. It really meant a lot to me how you sacrificed your sleep and took out time to meet me even with PCOM. I don't even want to think how life would be without you, because I know you will always be there for me (My dear diary :*). P.S.- Can't explain how I felt at the time when you said that your happiest moment on campus was not related to you, but it was when I got placed at Accenture. It am really lucky to have you in my life."
pgp31349,Sidhant Jain,.,,," Sidhant, we didn't get the opportunity to interact a lot, because we became friends very late, but I'm thankful that we did! You know very well how to irritate and tease people :P You were always a fun person to have around! Hope we stay in touch after IIML :)  "
pgp31350,Sumedha  Mittal,.,,," Sumedha. When I think of you, I am reminded of ""coffee"", ""shopping"", ""gym"", ""no alcohol"", ""desserts"", and other such very specific ""Munni"" things. The first of our great times together was that shopping spree during committee selections. When the batch was going through a nervous breakdown, we were busy getting high on shopping ;) That reminds me, you are the reason why I am such a big fan of Tommy slippers! Another first year instance that pops to my mind, is when I was watching a movie right before summers, and you scolded me badly to ensure that I didn't waste time. Term 4 brought us even closer, as we became neighbours. I just loved the stay at your place during the visa process. That reminds me..your mom is an amazing cook!! And ya, my mom loves you! Somehow, we shared our dislikes in humans. Loved gossiping with you. Munni, the best thing about you is that you are a very straight-forward person, with a chitchatting capacity that is infinite. I have met very few people who are as hard-working and goal focused as you are. Stay in touch!
                "
pgp31350,Sumedha  Mittal,Hottt,,,"Sumedha is actually a chhota packet, bada dhamaka. I absolutely love her outgoing, bubbly, fun loving attitude. Being my neighbour, she made all those boring lectures fun with her witty and sometimes not-so-witty jokes :P 
She is the biggest fitness freak I have ever met, and is always found in the gym. Definitely an inspiration for many, including me. I will always remember you gal whenever I have coffee. Be this awesome always, love you!   "
pgp31350 ,Sumedha  Mittal,Coffee_Expert,My,,"  Sumedha!!! Meri padosi…tu na hoti toh mere room mein aake mujhe lecture kaun deta calories kum karne ke liye..my source of motivation..ekdum chota packet bada dhamaka h tu…I will miss you a lot!! Tere room mein baithke bakar karna..coffee peena…gyming ke tips lena..and so many more memories…I am sure we will continue meeting in the future too…on our coffee dates :* Bas jaldi jaldi milte rehna, kaam mein bht busy mat ho jaana Miss Banker :D           "
pgp31350 ,Sumedha  Mittal,Favourite,,,"One girl always full of energy and who, irrespective of what happens, knows how to enjoy life! I have a lot to learn from you when it comes to determination and hard work. Stay happy, stay cheerful and just think a little more before you speak may be :P Love you despite everything and wish you get the best things in life :)   "
pgp31351,Surbhi Garg,sweet,,,"Surbhi!One of the sweetest people on campus, minding her own business and not intruding much. Going to a place unknown, your presence is one of the familiar things. I'm sure we would have many more good memories together in the coming time. "
pgp31351,Surbhi Garg,Beer-lover,n,n,"She's one of the sweeet ones. Our head cook at stex, she took the lead whenever it came to cooking. She's also the caretaker whenever you have group projects. She's one of the disciplined ones, who'd surely complete all the tasks well within the deadlines. We have common love to the choice fo drinks. Stex was pretty cool as she was there. Stay in touch, you!                         "
pgp31351,Surbhi Garg,.,,,"Surbhi, it was great to have you as my roomie during exchange. You are a real sweetheart and a very helpful person!  Stay in touch :)    "
pgp31351,Surbhi Garg,Smart,Sober,Smiling,"Lady, you remained favourite of many in the section and I can understand why. Your attitude has always been positive, from the time I have known you from IIT Delhi and I guess you have carried it forward. Thoda kam shaant hoja dost. Aise kaise chalega, ab firse consulting hi karni hai. Anyways, it is good to know that good, sensible people like you exist. Stay same lady and may you go on from success to success! Farewell and so Long! CHAI ki party mein leta hun Delhi aake tujhse :D 30th March ka benefit you see :)                   "
pgp31351 ,Surbhi Garg,BestFriend,,,"Undoubtedly, one of the best people I have met and I am extremely glad that we became friends. I wish I could be half as mature as you are! I have spent a great time with you and hope to spend a lot more in the future. Love you and keep being the wonderful person that you are. Hope you get all the success in life because you really deserve it :*     "

pgp31352,Sushma  Komarabathini,Sushi,Sweet,simple,"Well, the Aww says it Awwl! Don't kill me, the lord won't forgive your sins then! Jokes apart, the most religious person on the campus. Glad to know that people like you do exist! Irritating you to the point of insanity was fun and that you took it sportingly added to the flavour! I hope life gets better and better for you and that you do great! All the best!                                        "
pgp31353,Sushruta Mishra,BestIITBreed,,,"SIGFi was an important part of this two years journey at IIML. I couldn't have asked for a better SIGFi 31. I thoroughly enjoyed the times we spent, being there for one another beyond committee, to say the least. For all the times we spent together, parties, placement preps, quizzes, dealing with juniors and seniors, not dealing with them :P, goof ups.... all these shall always be cherished. It has been great knowing you as a person also (it difficult for others, you know :P), you are one brilliant guy who I can reach out to for all the fin/eco gyaan anytime. Stay this humble self always. And keep cracking intelligent jokes. Looking forward to a friendship for years and beyond :)     "
pgp31353,Sushruta Mishra,P/Q,,,"You have got to be the most irritating controls guy for me, and yet one of those I respect the most. You are one of the sharpest minds on campus and frankly I envy your intellect and knowledge. Over that your talent of PJs are some other level and the timein controls with yourPJs, especially the ones which left AS stumped were epic. Yeah you did irritate me a lot and well I guess I deserved it, but you were the most p/q of the whole lot and I really respect you for the same. Too cheesy? Bleh.! Joke maar le.    "
pgp31353,Sushruta Mishra,Shaant,Joker,Finance,"Mishra ji, haggode ke leader. I wanted to write JPMC here, but then, na, too much of it already. You are some dude, spontaneous and fun! I won't talk about your quantitative skills here, too boring shit that is. It is good to have come across someone as you! I hope Controls gave you enough time to conjure more shit which you could spread on! Have fun and all the best dude for everything in life man.                                             "
pgp31354,Suyash Sengar,Chillmax,,,"Suyash you are one person I've become good friends with only in the last one year. From our heart to heart at Marine drive to random walks to discussing random gossips and your never ending PJs, I never thought we would such great friends. You're one of the calmest people I've ever met and I'm sure we shall be friends for a lifetime. To Mumbai and beyond :)      "
pgp31354,Suyash Sengar,Kanpur,SS,,"You can take a boy out of Kanpur, but you cannot take the Kanpur(-iya) out of the boy!! We hit it off right away, with our mutual love for sports, quizzing and Man Utd. I have shared some great memories with you while quizzing as a team, participating in competitions and studying(?) for exams.  Incredible quizzer, finance god and an eternal source of blasphemous political gossip. I have always admired your confidence and your positive attitude. But, you really need to stop those cheesy phrases. Man Utd FTW!!!              "
pgp31354,Suyash Sengar,Calm!,Controls!,,Bhai PJs mein aap se kaafi seekhne ko mila! I regard you as one of the very few genuine persons I met on campus. The desi DJ of our party nights! Par sale tujhe bas ek hi dance step acche se karna aati h :P learn more dance steps from me dude! Lets rock it in GOAA!
pgp31354,Suyash Sengar,GGMU,MachauQuizzer,,"I haven't seen a better sports quizzer coupled with so much fin knowledge and logic and the ability to crack PJs in one person. Your transition from cracking a joke to immediately being the serious guy in the room always got to me and that is something I always looked up to you for. Your capacity of knowledge is something that I really envy, be it the random or obscure sports trivia or an analysis of some recent policy. Your diversity just amazes me. Your jokes were some real relief in the tense controls tent and you made ""chhakka"" one of the most iconic slangs in controls. Force be with you brother.You are destined for greatness.    "
pgp31354,Suyash Sengar,Brilliant,Dost,Charming,"One of my first friends in campus and someone I have truly come to admire! Dude, some of the best memories of Lucknow have been with or because of you! Can't ever thank you enough for that! Great times we have shared with and thanks to you. From quizzing, to section pride, to getting drunk during CV times, it was all so much fun and so much worth it! We didn't spend as much time in T6 as I might have thought, but I admire you for your sorted and balanced approach to life and hence I somehow feel good about the little time that we did manage to spend. Mumbai matches though are a memory for eternity. Miss you man, take care and looking forward to the next meeting! Farewell my brother.                                          "
pgp31354,Suyash Sengar,PJmaster,-,-,"Your stupid PJs, not-so-cool dance moves and oh-so-different hairstyle have made permanent impressions on my poor mind. I will never forget how you took time out to come to my place since you were in Mumbai and how you danced with us at Aatish's wedding. You see, you never ditch! Jokes apart, you have been a great friend. And there is no way I can forget you. After all, you were with me in both, 'F for family' and 'Credence for life'!    "
pgp31354 ,Suyash Sengar,Coolest,,,"I remember how in that induction party, you asked some serious questions after noticing my status, just saying this because sometimes small, little gestures remain in the memory. It has been great knowing such a smart and chilled out person.    "
pgp31355,Tanvi Bothra,DATA,,,"My Senate partner. Tu nahi hoti toh mera senate mein kya hota can't imagine. I wish we would have got more time to party with each other. I know I've been very bad friend, always passing comments on you. I hope you took it lightly. P.S. Jaipur ghumane wali hai tu mujhe. "
pgp31355,Tanvi Bothra,Beautiful,Sweetheart,Cute,"Sweetest, vivacious, dancing feet, always smiling and always cute. You are awesome.          "
pgp31355,Tanvi Bothra,TheManager,,,"My friend from Senate - you helped me create some of the best memories during the entire tenure. You stood by me through thick and thin. You made me feel welcomed at times when I didn't know what to do. We have had our share of private laughs and conversations. We knew we would be there for each other whenever crisis came. Though I have limitations to say more in a public forum, know that I truly respect and admire you for the person you are.        "
pgp31355,Tanvi Bothra,Sweet,n,n,"We became friends as we were both a part of placement charts team. She's one of the sincere ones and assumes the role of a leader at times. She made me do a lot of work during placements :P. We lived togethat during internship and that was the time when we developed even a stronger bond. She's fun to hang out with. I've never been able to understand how she lived only on oats for those two months. She's a lot caring as well and keeps feeding us with 'ghar ka  khaana' many times. Since I wasn't here during summers for PGP32, she used to tell me how much whole charts team missed me :P. We've had various outings togethar and they were all fun with her.  It was nice knowing her and we're undoubtedly gonna remain in touch.                                 "
pgp31355,Tanvi Bothra,Super_Sweet,Adorable,Charming,"Got to know you via Devika. But became a friend during ops work. Haven't met anyone on campus who is as sweet as you. I have no words to thank you for all your support which I had when I needed it the most. All our prep times, the walk n talk outside the fun mall, our outings and chats, every moment is precious. Thank you for being an amazing person n an awesome friend that you are. Will always stay in touch and will always cherish the bond we have :)                     "
pgp31355,Tanvi Bothra,BFF,,," Tanvi and I have a mutual friend outside campus, and that is the point which started our friendship; and I can easily say that she is the best friend I got from IIM-L campus. She is the most humble, generous and innocent person (can't deceive or hurt anyone). She was the only one I have met who matched up with my interest to roam in the city, eat food (especially desserts); and this is the reason she has been in almost all of my trips to different food-joints in the city. Tanvi, I would cherish our friendship and memories forever in life."
pgp31355,Tanvi Bothra,Innocence,,,"Ambitious, focused and caring - if you would ask me to define her in three words. The determination to achieve something comes naturally to her and I admire her for her commitment to it. She lacks all the worldly hypocrisy for her own good. I would only say ""Innocence and deliberate ignorance adds beauty in you, just keep it as it is"".             "
pgp31355,Tanvi Bothra,bacchi,,,"I have known tanvi from the very beginning on IIML life. From group study sessions, course projects and random hangout sessions the DATA group, as we were called by ppl, was created. She is  a really nice person at heart and One of the few who genuinely care for people. Poor Tanvi was mostly the target in the group for teasing. I have disappointed her many times and she has irritated me many times but it all goes to normal in the end. @tanvi: Kaash tu ""Prabhu"" ki iccha poori kar pati :D. friends4ever !!  "
pgp31355,Tanvi Bothra,DATA,-,-,"It has been our honour to have a DATA member with us! But despite being in such an elite group, you never showed us any attitude and was ever so friendly. Jokes apart, Tanvi, you have been a great friend. I shall never forget how you were there for me in sickness and health, even when we were new friends to each other. The way you get irritated when someone keeps secrets from you, the way you dance like a free bird and the way you are so passionate about things in life makes you adorable.   "
pgp31357,Ujjwal Kumar,Creative,Shaant,,"The logo was the start of it and I am glad it happened. Camaraderie was a watershed moment indeed I guess! Uske baad to many things went up in smoke and down in glasses. 911 ke kisse, apni wo female doggy (I call her Christy by the way) and discussions over assignments and what not! Fun run, and all other abstract stuff. Something that will be part of the folklore, always! Thanks for adjusting more than I could have asked for dude! You truly are a fabulous friend and a great person! Till next we meet!                                          "

pgp31358,Vaibhav Bhagwat,Maddy,Loyal,Helping,"HR, potential CR and what not! 15-inchy, you are probably one of the most giving people I have ever met in my life, forget about IIM Lucknow, and I say this with a little stress! You have always been there to support anyone who has asked for help and can't respect you enough for that. Strange that we don't have pictures together, especially since we have had so much fun together in your room! Thanks for Gravity and other experiences boss! They were enriching and somewhat life altering! Next rounds await and so does your wine! Thank you for everything maddy, everything. There are few people who have inspired me to be better at life, and you are one of them. All the best for everything my friend. I hope life treats you better than what you deserve and that you achieve all you ever desired. Farewell brother.                                          "

THIS LADY IS EASILY THE MOST ADORABLE THING ON CAMPUS! Even in her 'down and sad' states, she can lift saamne wala's mood just by her large puppy eyes <3.  I had hardly known her before we got placed in the same company for internship (SOME drama that was :P). And before i knew, we were roomies in Mumbai, easily one of the best times of my life. Each day in mumbai was a different experience, made all the more comfy and memorable by an adorable roomie/cointern. Our schedules and way of living were just perfectly complementary! The numerous dessert trips, the introspection sessions by the sea, and the bond created forever :)  Baby panda, we might not meet or talk everyday, but i know you are there, always :D  Stay blessed!

pgp31359,Vaishali Sabherwal,Sweeeeet,Chubby,Lazyyy,"My first friend at campus (neighbour during induction) and the bond is unbreakable. She's one of those, whom I can call anytime for anything without thinking even for a moment. Had a great time at campus as well as at STEX (where unfortunately for her, I was her roomie :P). She's the lazy one but somehow she manages to do everything well within time and I haven't been able to figure out, how! She's extremely sweet and you can figure that out in the very first meeting. Have had numerous outings with her and she's ever-ready for one. An amazing person to hang-out with. We're gonna stay in touch, undoubtedly.           "
pgp31359,Vaishali Sabherwal,.,,," Vaishali, I think we are very similar in some respects, and that's why i have always found it very easy to relate to you. I would miss the time spent with you on exchange. You are a great cook, and a really accommodating person. Stay in touch :)     "
pgp31359,Vaishali Sabherwal,Lovable,Innocent,,"Class Rep of Section F. I don't think I have acknowledged her for all the thankless work she did throughout the year. So here it is. Thank You Vaishali. She is the sweetest girl beyond all doubt. You can't help but adore her. That's the way she is. We may not have been very close, but that limited interaction was enough to impress me with her intellect, aptitude and innocence. She has the capability and the desire to realize her dreams. Her beauty lies in her honesty and sincerity. I am grateful to have known her. Big Hugs!!    "
pgp31359,Vaishali Sabherwal,vaishali,,,Vaishali and we became truly friends after the eco class. She is a bada chatterbox. You will never be bored in her company. Multiple meetings in Mumbai during internship only solidified our friendship. Thodi bhulakkad hai .. logon ko bhool jati hai france jakar :P . But she is a good person at heart. The times have been memorable and I hope that this friendship will continue beyond the chapters of IIML.  
pgp31359,Vaishali Sabherwal,CutenessOverload,,,You are undoubtedly the sweetest and the cutest person I have ever met. I can only imagine someone to be this innocent. We started talking way before we came to this campus and I liked you from day one. You are the best partner I could have hoped for be it be for projects or for prom. I never saw you angry or complaining. I loved hearing your super innocent doubts. We did not have regular conversation but you were and will always be close to my heart. You are and will always be my baby. I wish you all the happiness of this world and lots of love!  
pgp31359,Vaishali Sabherwal,CloseBud,Cutest,Lovable,"When I came to Lucknow, I came with some simple things in mind. Going away with some really close friends was one of those little points. A year at Paris, and with some unfortunate changes in life made me feel that I would fail at it again. Luckily, you have made that little difference which makes me feel glad about things and at the same time which will make me miss campus a little more. I am thankful for the way our friendship has progressed. In times when I have had no one, I have had you and trust me, I will always remain grateful for that. Thank you so much Vaishali, for little things that mean a world to me. For being there to see me off every time, to those wonderful veggies in Paris and for being there for me in Term 6, when I needed a friend the most. You are joy of a person, with such a warm smile and I hope that it only gets warm by the years. I appreciate all that you did for us as Section F and for me as an individual. I have so many friends thanks to you. And above all, I respect your opinions and some really good advices that you have shared. Lady, you have contributed to making Lucknow a really nice memory. Beyond this, I hope we finally travel more together. Good luck for whatever life throws at you dost.                    "

She is somebody who can always be trusted and comes with a positive vibe of energy. She will always be a special part of my memories at IIM.

The countless hours spent in Panel Room 2, discussing single topic for hours, creating a consensus at 4 AM when most of the college is fast asleep and running summers and finals process were some of the most cherished memories I had on campus with you. Last 2 years were a roller coaster of emotions which taught me how people from completely different backgrounds like us can come together and perform a task to near perfection if they believe and stand with each other as mentioned in the Three Musketeers film ""All for one and one for all"". I know our friendship ki picture abhi baaki hai mere dost.. looking forward to more pcom get together with you after HELL :)  "

He will sleep early and peacefully and still score more than the group. Thank you for being there as a confidante, advisor and most importantly as a friend. Will miss our punjabi songs pe dance!!

And of course there are so many things to be tense about, right? Of course, somebody did a little better than him, maybe even got a little more marks, and that should be such a tense time, isn't it?..:P For the entire second year, we have practically every single subject together, and watching him closely for the past year, all I can say is that he is a great person, but someone who should be advised to take a chill pill (like 4-5 times a day, maybe?). Well, I have my good wishes with you, of course, but more importantly, I will ask you to really take a step back, gather yourself a little and then go ahead. I know you will be great wherever you are! Cheers!"

An ardent follower of Quora and quite a writer himself, he follows news like a chick follows her mom. Discussions with him can be really heavy ranging from national politics to climate change and at the same time they can be ridiculously pedestrian as well. His ability to network and get insider information is unparalleled in my limited world view. He shot to fame in the group for making a spreadsheet that analysed some patterns that dropped everyone's jaw. My best time with him dates back to good old days when bikes were allowed on campus and we would go around the campus at nights discussing everything under the sun. His obsession with frameworks is so much that even in everyday discussions, there will be a structured response in place. He is that guy who would make a minute by minute itinerary even on a family vacation. This can come a lot handy especially if you don't care about things. Fun Fact: He once wore to class PJs, which were clearly not his. Survival Tip: If you like his blog, don't complement him. He will make you read every other article.

We were put in different sections subsequently but continued to remain such good friends!!We were also a part of the same Pcom group!!I, well, bunked a class for the 1st time to watch a movie with her. The reason I scored decent marks in all ITC quizzes was because she taught me so well. She even recommended my name to so many seniors for the Index MR teams. The 1st time I draped a saree was also because of her!!I remembered how nervous I was about getting it right for the Diwali Pooja in the mess. She was the one who said firmly that we'll wear it ourselves and let's not even ask our seniors. We ended up draping the saree for each other and did a decent job I guess. She hates it when I'm taken for granted and is genuinely concerned about me all the time. I know that I can approach her for anything.

Very restless, impatient and easy to irritate (which I obviously enjoyed). Can make a party lively by her dance moves. However, post the party she is one of the most difficult one to handle.

Surprisingly, you have acted in a sane manner and have told me what is right and what is wrong. If you remember the time I am talking about. Thanks for all that.

I remember about 8-10 of us sitting in my room and you with your tab and trying to ""study"" for the next day's exam. Though seems ages ago, that was the most memorable phase for me here :)
All the best and keep rocking! :)   "
pgp31376,Hardik Rupani,Hardick,Pops,," Hardick [Sic] is the ladies' man of our group. He is a running database of all the information you will ever need. His womanizing skills suddenly look small when it comes to his capabilities in Quant and Fin. While most junta is busy trying to save their asses during exams, he used to found chilling out and teaching the same stuff to practically dozens of people across hostels. One of the very senior prof from teaching QAM almost fell for him and there was such PDA that followed which left the entire class uncomfortable. He is a travel freak knows how to travel with a backpack. Having done a great deal of trekking himself, he never misses on any opportunity to click pictures of himself and specialises in fake candids. Extremely humorous and gels well with practically everyone out there. He is immune to cold and that's not really a concern for most but for his 'microminis'. He is true 'Sindhi' as per the popular stereotype and will come up with ingenious ways to save a few pennies. Fun Fact: He once 'borrowed' liquid hand wash from the mess. Survival Tip: Don't get very close to him, he doesn't bath much.  Song Dedication: Kis kis ko pyar karu, tumse achha kaun hai. "

The two years with you have been great, from watching movies to going on walks to the long discussions. Missed you a lot in term 5, and will in Mumbai. Stay in touch ! Hope you get the one thing you really want above all ! "

From the begining, I believe you have been one of THE only friend, jiske saath kaafi baate share kari hai. From career to random things, everything. You have always been there. When the Light Singh matter happened, tab bhi! Standing up for what you believe in, is what I have learnt from you. I don't know how would I thank you. It won't be very easy for me to live apart from such a good friend. I just hope we stay as we are always and always.          "

It's real hard to choose his single best quality… He's full of all the good things. Pleasant and cheerful personality, friendly behavior, well-bred nature, sincerity, mature way of thinking, trustworthiness, straight-forwardness, etc… few of the traits that he possesses. And yes, he's a very good listener… At least he listens to all my stupid stories with interest.
Above all hes alwayz dere wneva i need him n nvr turns away, i mus say ne1 cn depend on him at ne tym of da day.Evry1 hv ups n downs in their life but d problems nvr lasts fr long if v hv such special frnds lk him.

pgp31377,Hemant Verma,Hemu,,," I kind of see my under graduation days when I look at you – calm, composed and kind of reserved. It was great teaming up with someone who wont take any responsibility unless he sure of, but once taken will give everything to it. I prayed for you from 30 Jan, not because you were one of my friend and I was biased for you but because I know how much deserving you are.   "

It was during summers that you made me your love guru (ironic?) but it's been a year and I still don't even know any name(s). Anyways, keep sharing all the funny memes and videos. We do have a very similar choice when it comes to these. Also, I think we were one of those rare species who actually enjoyed watching ADHM :D Or maybe our company was awesome ;)
Cheers to our friendship!
Lots of Love,

pgp31377,Hemant Verma,Hemu,,," Hemu from IIT is one of the silent guys you will meet. He is often caught in a dichotomy of trying to be the bad guy but is perpetually caught being the good one. You would be lucky to have him in your project group as he is usually the one who would done everyone to start working well ahead of the deadlines. Having worked with him on numerous case challenges I can vouch for his ingenious ways of thinking. If case challenges presented his serious side, the gossip that followed post discussions showed he can be source of some really spicy information. One of the unsolved mysteries till date is what brought him to campus from home on the Diwali night. It was funny to watch him join us for few parties and look scandalized at the madness that unleashed. He is one of the people you can rely on in most distressing times. An interesting aspect is, even in the most stressful situations be will appear to be chilling out.  "
pgp31377,Hemant Verma,Hemu,,,"As I got to know you more, I realised I really admire your thoughts and attitude. Believe it or not, you are one of the few people who has led me to believe in a lot of things I didn't earlier. Hope you get all that you aspire to in life, all the best !! "
pgp31377 ,Hemant Verma,Hemu,,,"Shayad I met you very few times in first year, but second year has been amazing man! You have always surprised me with the strategic thinking and structuring ability you have. That surely surpasses many in this campus. I always admire you for this. Tu mujhe tharki bolta hai, yeh bhi suna hai mene! This is so not true! Agar mei tharki hoon, to tu mahatharki hai! :p be in touch always man! hamesha! jese bhi hai, we have good friend, always and will stay like this.  "

Even in controls, I realised, you were amongst the coolest guys there. And your love of football just increased that cool quotient. I have never seen anyone as resourceful as you, especially when it came to college related information. It was as if you had some access to the oracle of the campus and bloody knew everyone and everything about everyone on campus. Your vocabulary of slangs has got to be one of the most innovative I have come across, and made a major highlight of the whole controls memories i have.    "

Also, the countless number of times he has taught me before my exams! But the one thing that I will never forget (and I am sure, there will be many in my section G who will agree to the same!..:P)  is the amount of food we have gorged upon, courtesy Jayant! Whether it was to just keep myself awake, or just because I did not have anything for breakfast, or lunch, he always had something to munch (the advantage of which a lot of us have taken!).

Remember that Sonali's prank – it was a real fun to see you tensed (otherwise, she is quite a chill-out girl :D). However, I must say you are a gem to have (as a friend !!) in anyone's life. A friend who will be there with you definitely in your bad times (though won't care much in your good times :P). Thanks for all delicious foods (only I know how I ate those without complaining: P) you people fed me when I used to come to your flat during stex.

Even the sprain bandage does not stop you from playing :-D. You are that immensely thoughtful and emotional person who won't let your friends know how much you care for them.

You fix my problems from something as trivial as dinners I used to mess up in Mumbai or my wardrobe woes to some tiff with a friend or the various dilemmas I have had. You infuse sense in irrationality, and insanity in normality– all for good.  You've always been there for me with patient ears, a comforting shoulder, and unconditional love. I love your sincere smile, that compassionate heart, and that gentle blink of eyes to signal that everything would be alright. From shopping to working out to dancing to cooking to crying to laughing – you have always been my partner – across Lucknow, Ahmedabad and Mumbai. Thanks for always being there – through thick or thin (I am talking about situations here and not my shape).                  "

I couldn't stop laughing as I replied, ""Nahi Nahi main jaanta hoon."" Coming to IIM Lucknow, she had high aspirations as she enjoyed every bit of initial few days in TERM 1. A very active participant in class, Kanika is one girl who doesn't let her ambition fazed by those around her. 
A die-hard marketer, Kanika knows her brands well. Her love for colours, decorations and variety makes her the perfect know-all consumer. This quality of hers helps her to know the other side of marketing and hence, giving her the wholesome, overall view of marketing. A born athlete, Kanika has many achievements in both track and field events. This athleticism of hers, also helps her with her talent of dancing. An active member of Random Walk, Kanika can perform difficult dance steps with ease. Best wishes for Kanika for her future career and let us hope, for her at least, ""SKY"" should not be the limit.

pgp31381 ,Kanika Yadav,Cute,Live,All," My best friend in college. Easily the most cheerful, ever smiling and positive person I have met. Really amazes me, how you can manage all your work despite delaying it till the last moment. The dedication and passion that you have for everything you do and the effort you put in is really commendable. Your love and interest in Marketing is unparalleled. It's really amazing how you had set your priorities straight and didn't apply to HEPP companies for the lack of marketing firms. It takes a lot of courage to do that. You are the live wire of INDEX. Ever ready to do work be it of any vertical. Took lead in everything be it Wing meetings, Junior Induction or even parties. And that's not it. One of the most enthusiastic member of Random Walk, trained dancer (the life of INDEX parties along with Sagar :P ) and a sportsperson. How do you manage all of that together? MBA could not have been the same without your company. Stay the positive and smiling Kanika that you are and I am sure you will rock Tata Sky. Looking forward to many more fun days with you ahead. "

You tolerated the incompetent GPS in my brain and came to pick me from Bodigrah to mess every damn time I got lost. You yet was there for me every time I got sick (and it's not few :D ). All the nights 4 of us spent of together (IMPO), I truly believed I got a family away from me. I yet again felt Mumbai home because of you.

Thanks for being with us in all the project group and coming up with some ideas of completing the project at the last moment :P. I was amazed to see your riding skills in Alibagh trip (the accidental trip :P). The way you handled the whole cake segment of IYR (when 2 of us were on stex) was quite appreciating. You truly deserve to be named as ""IYR manager of the year"". Wish you luck in all your future endeavor and thanks for being there for me and supporting me @ HELL. Stay in touch!!"
pgp31386 ,Mani Ram,Kutta,,,"One of the best guys over here. Hardly seen you saying no for anything, no matter how much work Rachit used to give to you :P. Right from the first group meeting for MM1 to several of our business meetings (which were never ""business meeting""), our bonding got stronger with each day. Sitting together in the class and discussing strategies for IYR to gossips to the plan of action for my crushes, we shared a great friendship. In the end, you know well who your true friend over here is. KGBH would be part of life forever. Wish you all the best and successful life ahead!!    "

pgp31387,Mayuresh Gajbhiye,Oldbuddy,,, I really do not have a clue how we became friends. But one thing is for sure that there might be not a common connection but still we have managed to be friends even after everything. This is really a great thing. Teasing grumpy along with you was fun. Wishing you a life time of happiness.

He has a humble nature but can be aggressive at times, if you breach the line. He is ready to party anytime, even if it happens during the exam times and doesn't take things much seriously. It was nice to have a friend like you Mayuresh. Wish you all the very best for whatever you do in your life in years to come...."
pgp31387,Mayuresh Gajbhiye,Caring,,,"The ever helpful, the ever caring person in the entire group. The only passion he has is solving Rubik's cubes! I have even forgotten how we became friends, and only because there were so many more memories after that! He would complain and fret the most because he had to take the responsibility of organising the entire group to get ready on time when we out together, but nevertheless that was his and his responsibility only. Will never forget the time when he and Chomu took care of me when I was really sick. Of course, I did not like being sick, but I found some really amazing friends after that. And the countless times he has helped me. I will not say thanks for that, because then there will be a long list of 'thank you's' coming up. So I wish you all the very best in your future endeavours, and be successful wherever you are! Cheers!  "

That is how bad you can be. :/ Anyway, keeping all jokes apart you have been an amazing friend since the time I have known you. Thank you for that. Keep in touch. "

Such a baby you are! Scared during a horror film, crying during an emotional scene, ufff! The crazyy of eating out, hating the same people together, and many other shared interests made us come close. How can I ever forget your hours of whining about your internship drama!! Post that your obsessing over a single company, which btw I still don't get. Your high indecisiveness of stex or no stex! The proud moment of you getting in your dream company... Your closeness with that one friend which brings a big question mark on you know what!! :p You taught me a lot of things Mohit Jain! Things that I could have never thought of. How this ""duniya"" works, how these ""log"" are.. what could be ""good"" ""beneficial"" and what not! Thank you for everything.. These two years wouldn't have been this awesome without you. Always keep up the hard work, this job won't be like post engineering. You may not be able to scam your way through it. JK! Will miss you :):)                  "
pgp31388,Mohit Jain,MJ,,," You sat beside me for 1 year. At first, you seemed like a very very serious person. Post summers there was a different Mohit Jain. Again  I saw the very serious MJ pre-Heep. Everything will fall in place man, Relax!! and it was great sitting beside you. "

He is been there for me when i needed advice on my career choices and what to do for studies, competitions , quizzes etc. and also for some of my sad moments and failures. Musa Bhai and me spent a lot of time together during the bidding of subjects of the second year. He has huge potential, and would definitely do wonders in life.

But apart from that, the memories have been awesome. We have so many things to remember when we go from here. Discussion on books, Jaipur trip, sanki outings, in-house parties, secret santa and yes of course, Pictionary. It has been an eventful journey with you. The way we used to tease you because of the video calls and what not. You were literally my confident in the campus. You knew what all was happening and you constantly tried to cheer me up. Thanks for being there. College life would not have been that fun without you.  "

I simply cannot imagine my life here without you. Be it our 1st bonding session at CCD or sleepless nights during placements or gossip-cum-chat sessions in either of our rooms, every moment with you is memorable. Our trips, love for food, endless talks. Ahh !! I'm so gonna miss all this. Our time together is limited, but in my heart I know that you are only an e-mail or phone call away at any given time.

pgp31390,Nidhi Zanwar,Gappu,Gappe,Gappad," Gappu! As we call her, joined our group a little late but it was her room that soon became our 'Adda'. From being a lovely host who could never say no to Noisy Intruders who wreaked havoc in her room to lending an ear to anyone who has a story to share, she indeed stood out as an individual you could bank upon. It will take a good few months and endless pestering before she will disclose any of her accomplishments to you and that's a league of its own in the MBA ecosystem. The best moments with her have been the profound discussions on human behaviour. She has an expertise in making extremely controversial (read filthy) statements without even realising and she would always be the first to realise as well. She's a YouTube buff and watches every stand-up comedy before anyone else. An avid reader, foodie at heart and someone who can almost qualify to be a Panda surprises the shit out of anyone when it comes to Dancing or Adventure Sports. Fun Fact: If you want to annoy her, just keep saying tch tch tch around her. Survival Tip: Don't let her mimic Janice (F.R.I.E.N.D.S) or sing when she is around you.

Yes Nidhi, I dnt have words to explain how much you mean for me. And putting this into words would do injustice to the fondness I have for you. Be prepared, because no matter wherever we are, I'll be calling you up to tell you all my problems not to expect a solution, but because I want to tell it to Nidhi.

We have discussed anything and everything possible under this sky during our time here. Yes, we did have our downs too but my love for you is eternal!! From the rishikesh trip to agra trip, from walks to mess and walks / jogs across campus, swimming, gymming, shopping, eating out, gossiping like crazy, dancing, watching random videos (remember the old songs and random friends scenes), studying together in library / bean bag, panicking at the last moment, dressing up and clicking pics, hating people together and what not!!!! This is a non-exhaustive list. I love you nikku baby and I will miss you so so much after graduation. Don't get married too soon!

pgp31391,Nikhat Kashmi,Nikku,,,"Nikku, meri jaan!
You are one of my closest friends here. Sitting beside you in section G was so much fun – Working on projects, presentations and teasing you with any random guy. It does happen these days that we do not meet this often or hang out very often, but whenever anyone of us needs help, we know we can fall back on each other. 
I swear I was so much stressed during your placements. There were times during the process when I really had nothing to say that would comfort you. I felt helpless at times. But finally Nikke, you did it man! You got the company that you really wanted. That was probably one of the most cherished moments of my two years here.
All the best for your future. I'm sure you'll do good.
Love you meri jaan :*   "

Remember our Alibagh trip and the bike ride (the way you fell from the bike :P) – oh God, that was hilarious. I was amazed to see your dedication for our venture and the way you managed it when we were on Stex (though u made many goof-ups and increased our workloads :p!). From a project group to business partner (of our venture), we have come a long way. I wish one day u complete ur space travel(hope u get what I mean!)

pgp31393,Nivedita Das,Creative,Dreamer,Vivacious,"Waving her hand in the air, smiling her brightest smile, down the road she walks, as heads turn towards her automatically, returning her smile equally brightly. She is a celebrity alright. Clad in Pink (mostly), clutching a pink diary, wishing for a pink keyboard for her laptop, she would perhaps eat more if the food offered was pink. The extrovert nature, general disdain for anything ""Food"", love for that annoying colour called PINK, and the happy go lucky attitude, oh we surely didn't have anything in common to become friends. That was till we discovered the common love for shopping during our 2 month internship in Kuwait. From there on it has been a consistent discovery of common hobbies from crafts, to book addiction, to collecting mason jars, to love for fairy lights and what not. After all ""the whole purpose of the universe's conspiracy to get me to IIM Lucknow was to meet her"", isn't it? Here's hoping that this friendship continues to thrive with her doing some awesome accessory shopping for me in Kuwait while I return the favour with a million dollar smile. 
I hope her celebrity hood touches new heights, as she progresses through her career! Reach out for the star girl, the whole universe is your playground. "
pgp31393,Nivedita Das,Nivi,,,The Chatterbox! Purely shawkeen ladki! With the variety of tea and chakna. In you I found someone equally enthusiactic about green tea.

Most importantly one of the best model that I personally know of. 

  "
pgp31393,Nivedita Das,PinkLover,,,"You were among the very few I knew even before coming to this campus and all I wanted then was us to share the same hostel. Such happiness it was when you called me up and told me your allocated room number because I knew that it could not be better: we became neighbors for two years. You are one of the reasons why hostel 12 felt like home to me. It was a routine for me to see your face every day and stand at the door of your room and just chat about anything under the sun. We shared such great times, stories, laughter, intense conversations on life, bitching, cursing what not. To knocking the door of your room when I was low and just wanted to crib to showing you my newly shopped random stuff, I enjoyed every bit of you being my neighbor. I will always remember your love for pink. Thank you for waking me up during exams and sharing the things when I ran out of them. I will miss you so much!   "
pgp31393,Nivedita Das,Pinki,,," Pinki! Everything from her clothes to her bag, from her stationery to her cupboard, is PINK.

pgp31393,Nivedita Das,Ms.,Selfie,Pinky," Walking around the campus, if you ever come across someone dressed in pink from head to toe, there is a good likelihood, you are heading towards Nivedita. While the PGP office made us neighbours it was mutual cluelessness and constantly waking up each other during the classes that forged our friendship. Some of the most memorable moments were trying to eat endlessly during classes especially during term 3 to keep ourselves awake. An exceptionally fun filled girl who is likely to give to give you some life lessons in 'Carpe Diem'. What would surprise you any day is the health conscious freak who can get unleashed on you any moment. She is one of very few at IIML who have the child like attitude intact and this in person who can give you life 'gyan' is indeed very surprising.  We shared adjacent PGP IDs, CUG numbers and what blew our minds was the fact that we happened to stay in the exact same locality as kids. Fun Fact. Once I tried counting the number of SKUs in her room and I gave up after hitting the number 500. #TrueStory Survival Tip: Don't even think of calling her Ms. Das, even if you want to act overtly professional. Song Dedication: The Climb, Hannah Montana "
pgp31393,Nivedita Das,Fashionable,Confident,Joyful,"""Dil to bacha h ji""- suits her perfectly (bcoz most of the time you behave like a child :P). She is the chatterbox of the college and one would rarely find her quite :P (though I love your company as I don't have to think for topics). She is one of the few person who loves to enjoy each moment at its fullest and loves to capture them in her camera (our selfie girl !! ). You have this unique ability of giving nicknames to every person. A BBQ fan (though health conscious :P) she loves to hangout and chill with friends.  Wish you luck in all your future endeavor and thanks for being there for me and supporting me @ HELL. Stay in touch :)               "

Talking to you about life, death and everything was so insightful that I can never forget that. How can I forget the club moments, I think they brought us even closer than we already were.

You are my over-thinker buddy! It is always fun to keep each other updated with our latest quests into the over-thinking arena. Though you cheated into snatching the crown from me, I'll earn it back pretty soon! (Yeah, I know right now you're probably saying ""Burrrr"" :P)
There are moments I cannot help but laugh at, even today. Be it the awesome trek we've been on (where you could be found resting on some nearby rock every 10 min :P),  the filth that is your mind (on the filth scale of Shilpy to Dewa, you're definitely a 0.9Dewa :P), pani puri by the naali, the massage wala at Juhu, you wanting to leave your kids in the mall (:O I hope your kids do read this and are vigilant while in the mall with you :P), the weird angle you bring in to almost all discussions, the way you try to end most discussions when you have nothing else to add – hurr, burr, blah :P
I cannot even begin to thank you for the support and care you showed when needed the most. There were moments I really wouldn't have been able to get through ""hell"" without your help.
Love ya! I'll miss you.   "
pgp31394,karthik P,Globemaster,,,"DCP King, Globemaster, a little crazy, yes, he is all of that. But one year of sitting beside him also made me realise what a deep thinker he is. I do not have many lines for him (coz I am not the Globemaster, he is!..:P), but this person thinks beyond where your normal thinking would go. And of course, as everyone in our batch must know by now, he takes a stand, no matter if someone does the same or not!  I know you will do great wherever you are, but still, khud ki taraf se thode good wishes bhi de hi deti hun! Cheers!        "
pgp31394,karthik P,Buddhe,,,"It's tuff to say goodbye to some people.. from term 1 when you loved your seat so much you wouldn't want to move even after classes ended to me breaking your glasses ever so often, it's been a long way. You proved me wrong - guys love to gossip and can gossip - and can stay awake till 6 AM doing that. Nainital trip was the best, and you know why ;) 
I can now atleast go for a ride on the Columbus (although not by myself) and the Ferris wheel ! You taught me one important thing - free riding is fun, and it's okay to get used to it ! 
There are things you just cannot do, even basic ones like dancing or playing cards. Anyone who tries to convince you otherwise, show them some of your pics, and your expressions will speak for itself !  Here's a paradox - I thought you are one old person, but it took me time to realise you are as much a kid ! 
You will always hold a special place ! Good Luck !
PS - I still maintain that Adhar is a stupid idea :p "

The countless hours spent in Panel Room 2, discussing single topic for hours, creating a consensus at 4 AM when most of the college is fast asleep and running summers and finals process were some of the most cherished memories I had on campus with you. Last 2 years were a roller coaster of emotions which taught me how people from completely different backgrounds like us can come together and perform a task to near perfection if they believe and stand with each other as mentioned in the Three Musketeers film ""All for one and one for all"".

One can trust him with anything, he has this sense of a calming reassurance around him. But just mention 'Lord of the Rings' around him, he would go into a frenzy! His humour, though few and far between, was sooo brainy!!! in fact, pehle i used to feel ki you are a tad bit condescending :P (confession time!!) But with time, i got to know whattey gem of a person you are, and how you can hold a conversation about anything under the sun :) I thank Disha for letting me know you, Mohanty :)                   "

I am extremely comfortable around you. From managing all my rants, tantrums and tirades over shopping, work, food, or gym, you have truly been quite patient with me and supportive of my decisions. I think such qualities 'come with age.' I love the way you handle people and situations. You are not one to deliberately draw attention to yourself – your work does that for you – which reflects your zest for perfection and a keen eye for detail. Disha became more than a committee because of each one of us, and you became more than a committee friend, well, because of me :D                      "

You believed in me, you made my HR answers look so much better! Thank you for that.. And lastly angrej.. :p it's sparse SCM and not spare part SCM :D:D                      "

You were my first best friend on campus and the time spent with you is something I will cherish, always. Be it completing projects/assignments together or giving you interviews you have supported me throughout (while making fun of me at the same time) 
Eating 'authentic Bengali food' at the 6 Ballygunge Place in Calcutta or eating at Mocha in Lucknow, I've always enjoyed your company. I still remember how you planted that idea of doing 'something crazy' during a 'party'. It has always been so easy to talk to you about everything under the sun You've been patient while listening to all my complains, problems and the endless chatter. More surprising for me was when you actually made sense out of it. you've been one of those very few people I know whom I trusted with all my insecurities and you've always encouraged me to realise my true potential. 
Thank you for being a friend I could wake up at 3 in the morning and talk to and for being a thorough gentleman (at least with me).
Oh by the way, that cute face that you make when you are embarrassed is adorable :D 
Love,
Kanika     "
pgp31398,Pratabidya  Mohanty,Mohanty,,," Pratabidya Mohanty! Cummon, say it! That's not that hard to say it. It was super fun to watch class after class, term after term professors messing up his name. With his quasi British accent and charm, this guy had carved a niche for himself in the heart of every lady I know on campus. You can experience the dichotomy of 'chilled out' and sincere in the same individual. Go for a smoke with him and the 'gyan' he will give can vary from GE avionics to latest gossip making rounds on campus. A very observant person and hence often has a knowing smile on his face. His association with 'Disha' set tone to a lot of conversations I personally had and you will realise that despite his usually silent approach, he will say the right thing at the right time. Fun Fact. His collection of fashion accessories will give a tough time to most women on campus. Survival Tip: Don't try to do a combined study with him. Second hand information, but quite reliable. "

The ever chilling attitude and taking things light is his specialty. But this carefree attitude was just acting as a curtain for his grades, intelligence, and hard-working nature. After all, he is a product from both IIT & IIM. He was my fellow ONGCian too. His online venture helped many of us in organizing our parties without worrying about the food and cakes. His ability to understand sarcasm and quickly passing witty remarks in his deep- baritone voice is also enjoyable.He is a 'badi waali tanki' and I've never seen him losing his control even after night long parties. After STEX, he treated us with funny-tasting drinks and all those night long chats in the parties are very memorable to me. You really made OIG journey very hilarious and vivid for all of us.

You are the most chill-out person I have met in my life. He was the surprise package of the section when he scored 8 pointer in first term (bhai bina padhe number kaise aata h :P). Loved the way you irritated Swati & Kanika during stex (though it's a different thing that they used to take out their frustration over me :P).  A big pizza lover, he loves to hangout as much as possible and will be ready to whatever plan we make. It was fun watching you doing bakch***- be it playing prank on Kanika, posting random funny pics on IYR site or writing about NIMUSA in class. .

I mean literally everyone and that too in front of them. Apart from that, your habit of telling stories- real and cooked ones- are quite hilarious.

The concept of time management is on perfect display. 
Be it any moment, Rajat is one person who is filled with unending energy of fun and laughter. Some people might not agree to his hunky dory style, but, that may be exactly the kind of attitude a Manager should sport. It is this ability of his that he turns out to have a good number of female friends. Most girls find themselves very comfortable around Rajat, as it is evident from their giggling conversations. 
He is a very able academic performer and his CV is a testimony to that fact. After all, not many people get a Mckinsey shortlist. He will be joining Colpal as Marketing and Sales Manager and we wish that he creates more smiles for everyone, as he always had.

He frequently suggests me to dedicate my degree to him as without him I wouldnt have even reached Lucknow.

pgp31404,Ritusri Ray,Ritu,,,"I cannot think of a better example of 'chota packet bada dhamaka' than Ritu! It was DDG's group assignments that gave way to our interactions. The firmness with which she dictated terms to the group left us all wondering if she is some form a dictator. Surprisingly, her absence in other subjects showed how capable she was in leading a bunch of people. When it comes to food her appetite is far bigger than she is and she has single handedly caused a mini ethical cleansing in the chicken world. If you make a puppy face and ask for 'Rosgollas', she will go all the way fighting with Airport authorities and get them to you. A happy go lucky person from a distance, she can get a lot serious if you have appetite for some serious 'gyan'. Her maturity was overwhelming during summers when everyone else was losing their cool and she sat there like nothing really mattered. Fun Fact: Whenever possible, just knock at her door and run away like you did as a kid. She will take a few centuries to figure out who it was. Survival Tip: Dare not speak ill of her previous employer. She loves them more than her chicken. Song Dedication: chota bachha samajh k humko :P  "

I got nothing there which is a different story but then we have been friends ever since!! You are a calm person Rohit except for two months that I saw you in immense pressure but somehow you managed but then we missed on that trip :D Anyway, had a great time hanging out with you guys, (probably the maximum restaurants we could have covered minus the stex :p), making fun of so many ppl we know and totally looking forward to the coming trip! :) There are a lot many stories to share. :D          "

The one thing I remember very well is the super fun AB ki classes :D. And because you were always the victim, it was absolutely hilarious for the rest of us :P Thanks for those moments :D
It is always fun to hang out with the gang. I wish you all the best for all your future endeavours.   "
pgp31406,Rohit Kumar,Wonderful,,,"A gem at heart, is how I would describe him. A single incident will always remain etched in mind when it comes to remembering him. I was really sad with my first term QAM marks and on our first day of Term-II, he just said ""Tere term-II k QAM ki zimmedari meri"". And he remained true to his word till the end of the term. Anytime, he would make sure that I was fully prepared for class (of course, the terror of Prof AB was a catalyst!...:P) It may not seem a big thing, but I know how much it meant to me. Will always remain thankful for that, Rohit. So here's wishing you good luck in whatever you do and may you always remain this amazing!         "

I was so amazed (and angry too once in 6th term- You Idiot) to witness the heights of tolerance displayed by you at all times. You are truly a charming and caring person. One of the very few innocent beings of our campus, you were always there to help the people around in need. You have invariably been very thoughtful, accommodating (Eating/Grad trip/Stex etc. etc.) and funny too. I will always cherish the friendship (initiated thanks to the seating arrangement of Sec-G) we have (developed so late..All bcoz of u :-D).#FriendsForLife. Remember the BIO quiz-O god..U taught me full. I was astonished to see our marks later (haha..). I am so grateful to you for having been able to click the pictures from my digicam properly (the only one to do so :-D :-D) during STEX (Kanika n Rachit to..bhaisaab..almost sab blur ;-p). I really wish everything goes well with you and you get what you deserve in life. All the very best dost!!! Stay in touch :-)    "
pgp31406 ,Rohit Kumar,Guru,,,"""Yaar polycopy me question no. 139 kaise solve hoga?"" You were the only person I (read it me and Rachit) reached out to for any problem.

open-minded, genuine, compassionate, and level-headed, she can always be counted on 
to listen and provide support when needed.  Her wonderful sense of humor,

She's the lazy one but somehow she manages to do everything well within time and I haven't been able to figure out, how! She's extremely sweet and you can figure that out in the very first meeting. Have had numerous outings with her and she's ever-ready for one. An amazing person to hang-out with. We're gonna stay in touch, undoubtedly.            "

pgp31409,Sakshi Gupta,Langdi,Safayi,," Langdi!
The post summer phase was the best time I spent here. And you were undoubtedly one of the major reasons. It was always hilarious to watch you being all ""OCD"" about cleanliness (I think you're fairly normal in this regard now), to discussing your career as Uppal's bai, to watching you fall every now and then and the rightly earned name ""Langdi"" that followed, watching you throw stuff in fear while watching horrow movies :P
Thank you for all these cherished memories. All the best Langdi and be careful while going up or down the stairs :P          "
pgp31409,Sakshi Gupta,Langdi,Green,,"Sakshi! Aka Langdi Aka Green Fairy! She falls more often than a typical two year old. As the solo non-engineer in the group, she was pretty clueless in matters of Physics, Chemistry and entirely clueless in Biology. She is still fond of playing board games like Ludo, Snakes & Ladder among other things. If you chose to play these with her, be hyper cautious to make sure she does not cheat. A kid at heart and in almost all her actions, you will be shocked when it comes to matters of economics. One of the early memories with her were on discussions on topics like 'do guys gossip?', 'plotting interactions between people at IIML' and similar crazy stuff. She will always be super excited about food and after eating miniscule amount, begin to burp. In matters of music, if she suggests a song, NEVER EVER listen to it and the precise opposite is true for sitcoms. You can see her mouth-watering while watching Master Chef or a professor from the HR area. Fun Fact: If you want to annoy her, tell her how shitty 'kali dal' tastes. Survival Tip: Act like you would do in an ICU in matters of hygiene in her room. Song Dedication: Nadiya paar paar karke, Jimmy Khan.  "

You are officially my first friend here. I still remember how excited I was to know that you've lived in my city, studied in my school; little did I know then that you've lived in every city possible. I remember you telling me your itinerary before the week we were to join – travelling to new cities every day; little did I know back then that was such a typical Shery thing to do: bar-hop, make friends, make strangers feel super comfortable. 
If I could ever adopt an elder sibling, I would totally adopt you – because no one else pulls my leg and looks out for me at the same time. For all the CCD sessions in Gurgaon, coffee escapes at IIML and the lunches to which I was always 15 minutes late, thank you &#61514;
You made life here so easy, you at times knew what I wanted better than me myself – be it food preferences or life decisions. 
And yes, I owe you the 10kgs chocolates. Official declaration – they shall be delivered in installments over the next year. In return, you owe me free coffee and Oreo shakes every time I come down to Bangalore!

Last 2 years were a roller coaster of emotions which taught me how people from completely different backgrounds like us can come together and perform a task to near perfection if they believe and stand with each other as mentioned in the Three Musketeers film ""All for one and one for all"".

pgp31419,SWATI AGARWAL,Sincere,Cute,Honest,"Luckily got good marks in first fin subject (not sure of subject's name) midterm and you thought I was a good student, meri asliyat pata hoti to shayad baat start nhi hoti humari.. :D I remember how u tried and forced me to study before exams and also kept telling me to get rid of my chilling habits... Like my mom.. :D You have been such a big part of my life here at IIML, be it studies, parties, movies, we have done it all together.. i don't believe it's coming to an end, these beautiful 2 years of our life at Hell.. thanks for adjusting with my habit of talking very less and being there to help, specially during exams.. because of u i could chill more, i knew you would be there to summarise the whole course in last hour before the exam.. :) parties were so much more fun with your dance moves and lively presence.. your honest, straight-forwardness is really appreciable and something to learn from.. I hope you keep doing awesomely well in your life as you did here and that beautiful charming smile stays on your face always.. we will definitely be in touch.. FULL POWER :) "
pgp31419,SWATI AGARWAL,DancePro,PartnerInCrime:D,,"Dude, you are my actual partner.. while others are just sitting doing nothing at any occasion, you are the one who accompanies me to the dance floor. So high on energy! We have so many shared feelings for so many certain specific people.. I think bitching about them is how we became good friends (haha :P - remember in mess). But we couldn't bitch more as you went to Europe and had the time of your life (lucky you). But lets get together again sometime to bitch s'more.. :D Ms Life of the party, always be so enthu-full :)"
pgp31419,SWATI AGARWAL,TNT,,,"Your notes are the source of true wisdom for the lost souls in the campus. The epitome of knowledge and insurmountable hardwork (even in STEX courses) you are, with ocassional explosions (courtesy: Uljhan) appeals to many (both on and off campus). #PhotoAchiNahiAyiTeri"
pgp31419,SWATI AGARWAL,Cheerful,Emotional,Shopholic,"""A friend in need is a friend indeed""- fits perfectly to you. I consider myself lucky to have a friend like you despite all the silly mistakes I have made (I hope u get the clue :-P). She is a bit emotional, but I think it is where her strength lies. She won't have a mask on her face and will tell whatever she is feeling about you then and there. I was quite amazed to see your dedication when we used to study together sometime in 1st year. It was like ""slow and steady wins the race"". Remember how the entire section depend on your class notes to clear examination (that was quite a social service!). Thanks for all delicious foods (only I know how I ate those without complaining: P) you people fed me when I used to come to your flat during stex. No one gets bored in her company (a big gossiper!!) though very few people get such privilege. Wish you luck in all your future endeavor and thanks for being my friend-cum-adviser @ HELL:)
P.S – Stop spending all your money on dresses/fashion and spend a little amount on us too giving treats :P (Horlicks ka supply hi de dena ab )              "

pgp31420,Tampishree Choudhury,Innocent,Sweet,," Tampi you are the first friend I made here. U were a big support to me in my initial days. Though we talk really less lately and got out of touch but you will always have a very special place in my heart. We keep planning an outing but it never worked out. 5-6 years down the line whenever I will think about this college, your name will definitely pop up in my head. You are very innocent and stay the same. God Bless you.
Love,

pgp31420,Tampishree Choudhury,AdeleOfCamups,,,"I was in a dilemma whether to add you or not, because despite being batchmates and having a strong mutual friends, we actually never really interacted much. But then again I felt, what the hell. Before IIM I guess we never ever spoke a word, despite the fact that my GF was your roomie, and Gf's friends are usually close confidant in cases of mutual interests. Nonetheless, the time here,especially in all the NE parties were great with you. Despite being the only girl in the group for both the years, you never backed out of a party and were always cool with everything. I am a fan of your voice and those singing sessions will be a memory I shall cherish. It was great to have you in all those parties.    "
pgp31420,Tampishree Choudhury,Sweet,,,"You are simply a great roommate & a helpful friend who I could turn to anytime for help. Stay the sweet & innocent person you are. Our friendship grew from Trident Hotel,Mumbai to the 2nd year. Hope it grows further. Love you :* Will miss you. Stay in touch. Friends Forever. All the best. Cheers, Tanvi         "
pgp31420,Tampishree Choudhury,Sociable,Sensitive,Easy-going,"She is one of the first friends I made here. Very jovial by nature, she is a little talkative at times, but fun to be around with. The best part about her being not taking things too seriously and enjoying life to the fullest. She loves partying and dancing other than anything else. She is very good in striking conversations and can become friends with almost anybody. Though impulsive at times but she is quite sensitive towards handling any situation. Here's wishing you all the very best Tampi for all your future endeavors....  "

You have been an amazing friend since the start of our MBA. The strategic location in Section-G laid the foundation of our friendship :-D. Thanks to PGPacad ;-). Our chit-chat never ended since then..haha..and we became the best buddies. A very kind personality is what you possess. Your style quotient and dressing sense are unbeatable. Will always remember you as the biggest shopaholic I ever met- even I got this habit in 4th term..All bcoz of u :-D. My dance partner in all the Hell parties-my gossip buddy-a true friend in need-ear to all my worries-my late night chatter companion-an awesome singer-too much melodious-my roommate (pseudo :-D). I truly wish you get all the happiness in life. An honest advice- you need to eat well!! All the best babe..Stay in touch! :-)      "

pgp31421,Tarini Thomas,Awesome,Awesome,and,"This testimonial must be surprise I guess, considering we had limited interactions. However, I do have some distinct memories of you. The first being the Mumbai meet, then some interactions in the MR parties. I wish we would have spoken more, but I guess such is life. You are one of the awesomest (if there is a word like that), sweetest person I know. All the best :)         "

You are truly, truly beautiful both inside and outside. I remember what a boost you had given at a crucial time in our work :) Never said it, but thank you :) I wish you the best-est from the bottom of my heart, you bloody SOBO person :P            "
pgp31421,Tarini Thomas,SOBO,MalluGoddess,Prettiful,"Tars has inspired scores of people on this campus, the seniors and juniors by being part of Disha and people across batches found new hobbies like TKT because of her. I don't think there are many others who get the way she gets me. Wise beyond her age, she has the best boy and fashion advice. She has a heart of gold and spreads love all around especially when ""happy"". I will forever remember the fun times we had till a third wheel came along.              "
pgp31421,Tarini Thomas,Considerate,TT,,"Beautiful face, sharp mind and the sweetest of heart - you are truly a gem. I have never met someone as confident and as considerate as you. Working with you has been an absolute delight. We were the only two Disha members by default, remember. Disha became more than a committee because of each one of us. Thanks for being around. Love :*           "
pgp31421,Tarini Thomas,Helping,buddy,, Love you tars :) You are the most unselfish person I met on the campus. Thanks for being there with me through the tough times. I hope we will stay in touch.  
pgp31421,Tarini Thomas,Bombayite,,,"One of the first friends on campus! Somehow always had other plans every time you asked :( You're super awesome, girl! Hardworking, very smart, kind & helpful, Bombay Scottish swag to the core, pretty AF and that insane superpower of talking at supersonic speeds! I suspect Malludom underlying the last one! Definitely a person I'd have love to have hung out with a lil more, but let's correct that over the years?! Mwaah.. much love! "
pgp31421,Tarini Thomas,Pretty,Pretty,Pretty,"I know i am not your close friend and i have only talked to you twice or thrice. But i just want you to know that you have the most beautiful heart. You are one of the best person i have met in my life. ""Lucky 2017 IIM L Batch"" "
pgp31421,Tarini Thomas,Smart,Brilliant,Soft," We hardly ever a had much of a chat, but the ones we had always had a really nice tone to them. Something that I am glad off. I guess I will put this as an extreme case of 'Quality over Quantity'. Well, there is always time to catch up. I wish you all the best in the pursuits that life will bring. Hope the sun shines warm and that the breeze blows nice and cold always. Good luck and farewell TT                                           "
pgp31421,Tarini Thomas,Tars,,,"If I ever need to go into a black hole, Tars is who I'd want for company."
pgp31421,Tarini Thomas,Tarini,,," Apart from the usual talents that everyone must be aware of, Tarini has some skills which would be difficult for anybody to emulate her. One of the few people, who have an ability to hear other people out, Tarini comes across as a conscientious and a caring individual. Coupled, with her exemplary communication skills, Tarini has proven to be a worthy member of Team Disha.
I remember, once, after Summers, when I was asking everyone the question, ""How was your Summers?"", in came the responses with their unending stories of their experiences. When I asked Tarini the same, she quickly smiled and replied, ""It was good…and How about you?""
I was like surprised, because out of 20-25 people that I had talked to, she was the only one who asked me that. It is this ability of her to make the other person feel important in any conversation is what makes Tarini different from others. Very few successful people can do the same. She has already reached the tail of the Clouds, let us all wish that she sails above them for a successful future career.
  "
pgp31421,Tarini Thomas,Disha,,," Tars bro, pseudo mallu in the gang. I have never seen such a dedicated person like her. Whatever it be, academic work, committee work or sports practice she gives 110% and gets involved in it with full energy. Life is about constantly and never ending improvement and she reflects it with her actions. She is also a  walking zomato, who directs you to right eateries and a 'master'planner  "
pgp31421,Tarini Thomas,Campus_Princess,,,"With that dazzling smile, innumerable hugs and sane Disha-like advice, one can only wonder how many hearts you must have broken on campus! I will miss all the drunken showering of affection <3 :*          "
pgp31421,Tarini Thomas,Lifeline,,,"You're my lifeline at IIML - the elder sister, the pseudo-mom, the best friend, the committee colleague – you donned all hats with equal ease. As cliché as it may sound and I'm sure you've heard this way too often – but you're the nicest person I know, also the one with the fanciest friends: P
I am so glad I missed that first quiz, without which none of this would have started. I am so glad we ended up on the same bench, in the same section; in the same committee; because without you at each step, this journey would have never been possible. I am so glad we did L.I.M.E. together; thanks for being there through each of our milestones: P
This doesn't end here bro – I'm going to land up at your doorstep in Bangalore, often uninvited; I'll attend your wedding and be showered with the flowers; I'll gift nice little pink clothes to your kids and spice up your life with all little updates and pieces of gossip. 
Thank you for being there that every single time. I love you :*

pgp31423,Vineet  Kumar,Gymboy,,,"One look at him and you will know that he is one hell of a gym-freak! Thoroughly introvert by nature, it is really tough to understand what is going on in his mind. It's not like you have to break a barrier or something for him to open up. He is just that way. But don't be surprised if you find a warm and caring person beneath the demeanour he puts up before the world. He is softy at heart and an out and out foodie.
